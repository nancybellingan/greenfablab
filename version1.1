\section{Abstract}
\textit{This report describes the study of various approaches for production of biodiesel. It includes the detailed research about all the chemicals used for the production of biodiesel with respect to its cost and safety guidelines. In addition to this, a detailed study of the physical materials required for the development of a biodiesel plant providing the details of vendors providing better options. The prototype design of the model is created as a 2D and 3D model with details about the actual setup of the plant with complete user manual to build the biodiesel plant on a domestic scale. The safety instructions and risks involved are mentioned separately for every component used and the entire process of biodiesel production. However, the major advantage of this process is the usage of recyclable and degradable materials for the production, thus making the entire process greener and clean. In addition to this, the advantages and drawbacks of biodiesel are explicitly mentioned to give a clear idea of the need for turning towards the usage of biofuels rather than petroleum based fuels to contribute towards the cleaner and greener environment.}

\section{Introduction (Author: Kasturi More)}
The scarcity of conventional fossil fuels, increasing emissions of pollutants, along with the increase in costs have compelled users towards non-conventional renewable energy sources as an alternative. For the vehicles and transport, biofuels are a better approach even though not the best one. As we have electric cars or hydrogen cars which is more efficient than any of the biofuels. However, implementation of these solutions will take a years together to be realized in practice. Hence, biofuels are the effective solutions than fossil fuels. Biofuels have the potential to reduce the emissions of carcinogenic compounds by about 85\%. In addition to this, biofuels are less toxic, recyclable and biodegradable as the major ingredient for production of biofuels are waste cooking oils or animal fats, etc. This makes the production of biofuels much more cost effective (SG Biofuels, 2017).
Biodiesel is an alternative fuel which is similar to conventional fossil fuels. It is a renewable, clean burning fuel which is being used nowadays instead of diesel fuels. It is made of different mix of feedstocks which includes recycled waste vegetable oil, soya bean oil, and animal fats. Biodiesel is mostly blended with petroleum diesel in the ratios of 2\% (B2), 5\% (B5), or 20\% (B20). Biodiesel which is completely pure is referred as B100. These fuels can be used in regular diesel engines without making any changes to existing engines. Biodiesel can be stored and transported using diesel fuel tanks and equipment. The major benefit of biodiesel is that it is carbon neutral which refers that there is no production of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. Being completely non-toxic and rapidly biodegradable, biodiesel spillages represents very less risks compared to fossil diesel spills. Biodiesel has higher flash point than fossil diesel hence it is safe in the event of crash (Esru.strath.ac.uk, 2017). The world energy demand is on the rise and the most feasible approach to meet this growing need is by using renewable and non-conventional alternative fuels. Biodiesel, in particular from biofuels exhibits a great potential in meeting the demand. The term biofuel is any liquid or gaseous fuels which can be used in transportation industry produced from biomass. Biofuels have numerous advantages like energy security, environmental concerns, socio-economic issues related to rural areas, foreign exchange savings, etc. It is a well-known fact that transport is majorly dependent on petroleum or fossil fuels which emit various harmful gases like carbon monoxide, methane, etc and they are harmful to the human beings and environment. Hence, biodiesel, a biofuel, is a better alternative as it helps in reducing the toxicity of emissions and can be used with current in-use vehicles. So, it is a cost effective solution for immediate application and would help in striking a balance between economic, agricultural and environmental development.
