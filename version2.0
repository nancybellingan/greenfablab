\section*{Abstract}
\textit{This report describes the study of various approaches for production of biodiesel. It includes the detailed research about all the chemicals used for the production of biodiesel with respect to its cost and safety guidelines. In addition to this, a detailed study of the physical materials required for the development of a biodiesel plant providing the details of vendors providing better options. The prototype design of the model is created as a 2D and 3D model with details about the actual setup of the plant with complete user manual to build the biodiesel plant on a domestic scale. The safety instructions and risks involved are mentioned separately for every component used and the entire process of biodiesel production. However, the major advantage of this process is the usage of recyclable and degradable materials for the production, thus making the entire process greener and clean. In addition to this, the advantages and drawbacks of biodiesel are explicitly mentioned to give a clear idea of the need for turning towards the usage of biofuels rather than petroleum based fuels to contribute towards the cleaner and greener environment.}

\section{Introduction (Author: Kasturi More)}
The scarcity of conventional fossil fuels, increasing emissions of pollutants, along with the increase in costs have compelled users towards non-conventional renewable energy sources as an alternative. For the vehicles and transport, biofuels are a better approach even though not the best one. As we have electric cars or hydrogen cars which is more efficient than any of the biofuels. However, implementation of these solutions will take a years together to be realized in practice. Hence, biofuels are the effective solutions than fossil fuels. Biofuels have the potential to reduce the emissions of carcinogenic compounds by about 85\%. In addition to this, biofuels are less toxic, recyclable and biodegradable as the major ingredient for production of biofuels are waste cooking oils or animal fats, etc. This makes the production of biofuels much more cost effective (SG Biofuels, 2017).
Biodiesel is an alternative fuel which is similar to conventional fossil fuels. It is a renewable, clean burning fuel which is being used nowadays instead of diesel fuels. It is made of different mix of feedstocks which includes recycled waste vegetable oil, soya bean oil, and animal fats. Biodiesel is mostly blended with petroleum diesel in the ratios of 2\% (B2), 5\% (B5), or 20\% (B20). Biodiesel which is completely pure is referred as B100. These fuels can be used in regular diesel engines without making any changes to existing engines. Biodiesel can be stored and transported using diesel fuel tanks and equipment. The major benefit of biodiesel is that it is carbon neutral which refers that there is no production of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. Being completely non-toxic and rapidly biodegradable, biodiesel spillages represents very less risks compared to fossil diesel spills. Biodiesel has higher flash point than fossil diesel hence it is safe in the event of crash (Esru.strath.ac.uk, 2017). The world energy demand is on the rise and the most feasible approach to meet this growing need is by using renewable and non-conventional alternative fuels. Biodiesel, in particular from biofuels exhibits a great potential in meeting the demand. The term biofuel is any liquid or gaseous fuels which can be used in transportation industry produced from biomass. Biofuels have numerous advantages like energy security, environmental concerns, socio-economic issues related to rural areas, foreign exchange savings, etc. It is a well-known fact that transport is majorly dependent on petroleum or fossil fuels which emit various harmful gases like carbon monoxide, methane, etc and they are harmful to the human beings and environment. Hence, biodiesel, a biofuel, is a better alternative as it helps in reducing the toxicity of emissions and can be used with current in-use vehicles. So, it is a cost effective solution for immediate application and would help in striking a balance between economic, agricultural and environmental development.
\subsection{Biodiesel}
Biodiesel is a replacement fuel for diesel to be used in diesel engines which is manufactured from plant oils i.e. soybean oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, canola oil, or recycled cooking oils, or animal fats and various other combinations of feedstocks. Used cooking oils or waste vegetable oil are plant based but may contain animal fats and are recyclable and renewable. The manufacturing process converts oils and fats into chemicals named long chain mono alkyl esters or biodiesel. These are mainly referred as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and the process is called as transesterification.

\end{figure}
\newline 
Biodiesel is an alkyl ester of a fatty acid which is made from vegetable oil but it is not a vegetable oil. If there is 100\% biodiesel, it is known as B100 which is a vegetable oil that has been transesterified to produce biodiesel. It is important that the biodiesel produced meets the ASTM biodiesel standards so it qualifies for warranties and can be sold as biodiesel to get tax credits. It was assumed that vegetable oil can be directly used as a fuel for engines but it can cause carbon deposits, poor lubrication, engine wear and hence deteriorates engine over time. This is due to high viscosity of vegetable oils compared to other fossil fuels or biodiesel. Additionally vegetable oils have natural gums that cause plugging in filters and fuel injectors. There are various options to resolve these issues like blend with petroleum diesel up to 20\%, preheat oil, mix oil with alcohols for emulsions,crack the vegetable oil, or transesterification of vegetable oil into biodiesel. The below table gives a major reason for transesterification of vegetable oil into biodiesel rather than using it directly as a fuel in diesel engines. Oil has very large viscosity which is a major concern in cold weather hence biodiesel is better alternative to fossil fuels.

\subsection{Benefits of biodiesel}
\textbf{Easy to Use}: Biodiesel can be pumped, stored and used quite similar as petroleum diesel fuel. The great advantage of biodiesel is that it can be used in currently used engines, vehicles and infrastructure without any changes. Also, biodiesel can be blended in various proportions with petroleum diesel fuel. The availability of biodiesel pumps is improving every day.
\newline
 \textbf{Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions}: The analysis conducted by Argonne National Laboratory found that B100 has 74\% less greenhouse gas emissions compared to petroleum diesel. In addition to this, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Energy jointly conducted a study and determined the net carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere using biodiesel is 78.5\% compared to petroleum diesel fuel. Also, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) reported similar details for lifecycle analysis of biodiesel from different sources. Biodiesel is the only fuel to complete U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted rigorous emissions and health effects study under the Clean Air Act successfully. This biofuel reduces effectively emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, unburned hydrocarbons, and sulfates compared to petroleum diesel fuels. Mostly biodiesel is also blended with petroleum diesel, so the emissions reductions is proportional to the amount of biodiesel present in the blend. Biodiesel helps to minimize the risk of global warming by reduction in carbon emissions to the environment. \newline \textbf{Energy Balance and Security}: The ratio of energy needed to produce, refine and distribute the fuel and the amount of energy released by the fuel when it is burned is called energy balance of fuel. This helps to determine how much renewable, a fuel is. The higher the value of this ratio, lower is the environmental impact because low fossil fuel energy is required to produce, refine and distribute the fuel. A study noted that on an average biodiesel releases 3.2 units of energy per unit of fossil fuel energy to produce it whereas diesel fuel delivers only 0.83 units of energy per unit of fossil fuel energy to produce it. Security of energy is the recent topic of concern for the government and society. Many countries are dependent on import of various fossil fuel energies like coal, oil and natural gas. If the supply of this energy is disrupted, then it would result in a threat to country’s economy with no fuel for factories, transportation, run power plants and household related needs. If domestic crops are used to produce biodiesel for fuel consumption in respective countries, one gallon of biodiesel will replace one gallon of imported crude oil and hence reduce dependency on foreign fuel supplies. Moreover, biodiesel produced in dedicated refineries would increase overall domestic refining capacity, refraining from import of expensive finished product from foreign countries.

\subsection{Drawbacks of biodiesel}
\textbf{Variation in energy amount of biodiesel:} Biodiesel can be obtained from various crops. When these oils are extracted to convert them to biofuel, the obtained biodiesel can vary in producing power. Hence, all the biofuel crops fail to produce the same amount of energy. \newline\textbf{ Unsuitable at low temperatures:} Biodiesel freezes at lower temperatures but the temperature at which it will freeze depends on the oil or fat used for its production. The effective solution for this would be to blend biodiesel with winterized diesel fuel.\newline\textbf{ Increased use of fertilizers}: Excessive demand of crops to produce biodiesel would imply more production of crops and eventually excess use of fertilizers which will have major drawbacks to the environment. This would result in land pollution and soil erosion. \newline \textbf{Food scarcity}: Majorly biofuels are produced from animal or vegetable fats which may lead to increased prices of these commodities and may even create scarcity of them in some countries. Once the crops become expensive, it would affect poor people from purchasing it. \newline\textbf{ Engine clogging}: Biodiesel helps in removing dirt from engines. On the contrary, this dirt get collected in the fuel filter and hence causes engine clogging. \newline \textbf{Regional suitability}: Few oil producing crops are not suitable to be grown in many regions. Hence, they have to be transported to particular regions which results in increased costs and emissions due to transportation. \newline\textbf{ Water shortage:} The production of more crops for biodiesel production might result in more pressure on the local water resources. This may affect the water supply for other important necessities in the region and hence, producing oil crops in water shortage regions could not be recommended. \newline \textbf{Fuel distribution}: Biodiesel is newly developed biofuels used as transportation fuel and hence is not distributed across like petroleum diesel. The infrastructure needs to be developed further to make the usage of biodiesel as a commonly preferred fuel for engines. \newline  \textbf{Nitrogen oxide emissions}: Biodiesel results in 10\% more emissions of nitrogen oxide than the petroleum fuels. Nitrogen oxide results in the formation of smog and ozone and if it dissolves in atmospheric moisture, it can cause acid rains.
\section{Background (Author: Kasturi More)}
In 1890s, Rudolf Diesel invented a diesel engine such that it can run on variety of fuels including vegetable oil. Then in the 1930s, splitting of fatty acids from glycerin in vegetable oil to create thinner products similar to petroleum diesel. G. Chavanne was granted a Belgian patent in 1937 for ethyl ester of palm oil which is now known as biodiesel. In the following year, a passenger bus was fueled with palm oil ethyl ester on the route between Brussels and Louvain. During the World War II, the petroleum fuel supplies were interrupted hence vegetable oil was used as fuel by many countries like India, Argentina, Brazil, China and Japan. Rudolf Diesel had demonstrated his engine which used peanut oil at the Paris World Fair. At that time, he and Ford believed that the biomass fuel would be the real future of his engine. However, after the end of the war, when the petroleum fuels became cheap and in abundance, vegetable oil fuel usage halted or rather forgotten. The business and the cost involved in the petroleum industries influenced the development of engines and hence their construction was done to accommodate the new cheaper fuels eradicating the potential use of biomass fuels (Articles.extension.org, 2017).
In the 1970s, an embargo on petroleum oil caused several countries to turn towards vegetable oil as a potential fuel. Eventually, it was rediscovered that straight vegetable oil could be used to run the diesel engines by the scientists in Austria, the United States, South Africa and many others. But the poor quality of fuel spray caused due to the thickness of vegetable oil resulted in damage to the engines. Hence, several experiments were conducted to convert vegetable oil to biodiesel. The word ‘biodiesel’ was used first in 1984.
The first biodiesel manufacturing plant was designed to produce fuel in 1985 in an agricultural college in Austria. Later, it has been manufactured commercially across Europe since 1992 with Germany being the largest producer. Also, in the United States, biodiesel was commercially manufactured first in 1991 in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1995, Yellowstone National Park used the fuel in a truck which had been driven several hundred thousand miles without any harm to the engine and even currently in use. The biodiesel was provided by the University of Idaho. Due to this, other national parks began using biodiesel as an alternative fuel for the vehicles. Although it became popular, uneven quality was one of the problem with biodiesel. Hence, in 2001, a standard ‘ASTM Standard D6751’ for biodiesel was published by ASTM International, one of the world’s largest voluntary standards development organizations. This standard satisfied several engine manufacturers and fleet managers with the biodiesel meeting their quality requirements.
\section{Motivation (Author: Anjali Singh)}
Fossil fuels are the major sources of energy production today and the World consumes 11 billion tonnes of oil in fossil fuels every year. It has been predicted that with the current consumption rate, fossil fuel reserves would be completely depleted by 2080 [1]. Furthermore, they are one of the prime reasons for ever increasing emissions of harmful gases in the atmosphere. There is an immediate necessity to switch to alternate fuels.
One of the alternatives for energy production which could substitute fossil fuels is Biodiesel. Biodiesel is produced through oil crops and bio wastes such as animal fat, non-edible oils and waste cooking oils. Typical oil crops such as rapeseed, soybean and palm contain large amounts of oil, which when treated, show similar properties as Diesel fuel. This treated fuel (or the Biodiesel) can be directly substituted in all the areas which use Diesel as the fuel. Biodiesel reduces emissions of carcinogenic compounds by 85\%, unburned hydrocarbons by 67\%, carbon monoxide by 48\% and particulate matter by 47\% compared to fossil fuels [2].
Biodiesel also helps in waste management, as the improper disposal of waste cooking oil could pollute the air as well as water. The pollution caused by oil crops is far more severe compared to the waste cooking oil and even the diesel fuel. Rainforests have been badly affected by palm crops, one of the main oil crops used in biodiesel production, in the Southeast Asian nations [3]. Utilization of such waste cooking oil and the oil crops to produce Biodiesel would hugely benefit waste management as well as pollution control.
The process of biodiesel production takes place through Transesterification using Methanol or Ethanol as the catalyst. Methanol is produced from natural gas, a fossil fuel, and it’s highly toxic and hazardous which makes it less suited as the catalyst. Ethanol, on the other hand, is less toxic compared to Methanol and if it’s consumed in the body, it gets converted to acetic acid (a form of vinegar). So Ethanol is used as the catalyst in the transesterification process of this research work.
\section{Literature Research (Authors: Navyashree Birappa \& Anjali Singh)}
Alejandro Sales from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden has demonstrated in his Master Thesis the production of Biodiesel from sunflower oil and ethanol using sodium hydroxide as the catalyst. He also demonstrated the change in properties of biodiesel when the quantity of the additives is changed. He concluded from his experiments that the yield of biodiesel increases with ethanol/oil ratio (Sales, 2011).
N.S. Caetano et. al., in 2012 evaluated the production of biodiesel from vegetable oil by enzymatic catalysis with ethanol as reagent and hexane as co-solvent. The evaluation results showed the best operating conditions of oil/alcohol molar ratio of 1:4, 10\% of hexane co-solvent and 48 hrs of reaction time (Caetano et al, 2012).
Another research was carried out by Surya Unni K et. al., in 2013 wherein biodiesel was produced from waste cooking oil of FFA (Free Fatty Acids) 4-5\% using methanol and sodium hydroxide as catalyst. They performed three tests by varying the reaction time and evaluated the results. The results showed that a maximum biodiesel yield of 99.09\% was obtained for 1.5 hours of reaction time, 7:1 molar ratio and 1\% of sodium hydroxide (Unni K et al, 2013).
Junaid Bin Aamir (2014) et. al., developed a low cost pilot plant for biodiesel production at domestic level. They produced the biodiesel from waste cooking oil, evaluated the results and compared them with the biodiesel standards. The yield capacity they observed was 80\% for 2-3 hours of reaction time. They also evaluated other properties and found them to meet the biodiesel standards (Bin Aamir et al, 2014).
Anne Marie Helmenstine has explained the process of producing Biodiesel from new vegetable oil using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and methanol. Experiment was carried out by mixing 3.5gm of NaOH and 200 ml of methanol for 1ltr of new vegetable oil at temperature 70°F which resulted in production of Biodiesel and Glycerin as by-products (ThoughtCo, 2017).
Zhiyou Wen et al., at James Madison University in 2017 explained the method of making own biodiesel in mainly 3 steps. First is the transesterification between triglyceride (oil) and alcohol (methanol), titration step to determine the total acidity of waste oil and in final step esterification of waste oil is carried out using product obtained from transesterification. The proportions used to carry out the experiment where 1ltr of fresh vegetable cooking oil, 250ml of pure methanol, 3.5gm of NaOH/ 5grm of KOH at temperature ~140°F ( Zhiyou Wen et al, 2017).
Iso et al., showed the alternative method of using lipase as a catalyst in the production of biodiesel. This method overcome the drawback of removal of catalyst and excessive energy requirements of chemical processes. This method is not yet been adopted industrially because of its high cost of enzyme catalyst. The methods involves immobilization of enzymes (0.6g of lipase) using 60ml of phosphate buffer and 3g of toyonite. Later transesterification reactions carried out by 3:1 ratio of triolein: alcohol using 0.1g of lipase at 220°C (Iso et al, 2001).
Musa explains the effect of alcohol i.e. methanol is the best suited than ethanol, since it possess azoetrope property and easy to recover. Also conducted several experiments and concluded that the best suited Molar ratio of triglyceride to alcohol is slight more than the Stoichiometric Molar Ratio 3:1M. That is 6:1M when methanol is used and 9:1 M when ethanol is used. Higher the molar ratio, more is the complexity of separation of biodiesel and purification process (Musa, 2016).
\section{Different methodologies for biodiesel production}
\subsection{Base catalyzed transesterification}
This method involves removal of glycerin from the fatty acids using a catalyst such as sodium or potassium hydroxide and replace it with an anhydrous alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol (preferably small chain alcohols). This produces methyl or ethyl ester and glycerol, a valuable by product used for making soaps, cosmetics, etc.
It is an economical method of producing biodiesel as it gives over 98\% yield and has direct conversion to biodiesel without any intermediates. Also, it requires low temperature and pressure with no specific material requirements to build the model.
\subsection{Acid catalyzed transesterification}
Due to the limitations of base catalyzed transesterification with its sensitivity towards the purity of reactants and moisture and FFA content of used oil. Acid catalyzed transesterification are insensitive to FFA content and can simultaneously catalyze both esterification and transesterification process. Mainly used inorganic acidic catalysts are hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, and sulfonated organic acids.
However, acid catalysts have relatively slower reaction rate and requires higher alcohol to oil ratios for better yield of biodiesel. Other disadvantages include acidic effluent, non-reusable catalyst and expensive equipment required.
\subsection{Two step transesterification}
The drawbacks of saponification in base catalyzed and slow reaction time in acid catalyzed transesterification have compelled researchers to adopt two step transesterification. In the first step, esterification of FFA is performed using acid to decrease the FFAs level less than 1\%. In the second step, transesterification of obtained oil is performed using alkaline catalyst. Hence, this process involved advantages of non-acidic waste water, high efficiency, low equipment cost.
Although, it has many advantages, this process faces the problem of catalyst removal in both stages. However, the effect of acidic catalyst in the first step can be neutralized by adding extra alkaline catalyst in the second step. But, extra use of alkaline catalyst eventually increases the cost of biodiesel.
\subsection{Transesterification using heterogeneous catalysts}
Heterogeneous catalysts have a basic advantage of easy separation from the reactions and reusability. Hence, it makes the process green. This process does not require any catalyst recovery or aqueous treatment steps as the purification steps are very simple and yield high amount of alkyl esters approximately equal to the theoretical value. Glycerin, the byproduct obtained is highly pure (98\%) and does not contain any salt contaminants. In addition to this, there is no soap formation due to the use of heterogeneous catalysts while solid acid catalysts have strong capability to replace liquid acids removing the corrosion problems and environment threat posed to them.
Acid zeolites, heteropolyacids, ion-exchange resins and immobilized sulfonic acids and sulfated zirconia and mixed metal oxides are some of the heterogeneous catalysts. Although there are advantages of being easily separated from products, recyclable, good stability and environmental friendly, there needs to be further research conducted expecting positive results in this direction.
\subsection{Enzymatic transesterification}
Currently, enzymatic catalysts are used in commercial production of biodiesel fuel. It is highly efficient, highly selective, less energy consumption, and produces less side products or waste. The enzymatic reaction is based on the use of biocatalysts as lipases which catalyze the hydrolysis of fats and vegetable oils with formation of glycerol and linear chain esters.
This approach is said to be environmental friendly, commonly considered a green reaction. However, the cost of final enzymatic product poses problems as compared to economical chemical catalysts. Hence, there is a need for further research to be done to implement this for industrial production of biodiesel.
\subsection{Non-catalytic transesterification}
This approach was developed to solve the problem of reaction limitation lag caused by poor methanol and oil miscibility. Tetrahydrofuran, a co-solvent was chosen due to its boiling point close to methanol. With 6:1 methanol to oil ratio, 1.25 volume of this co-solvent per volume of methanol produced an oil dominant one phase system in which methanolysis speeds up without agitation and at ambient temperatures and pressures. There are no catalyst residues in esters or glycerol.Another non-catalytic method is using methanol at very high temperature and pressure called as supercritical methanol. At 350-400 C and >80 atm and 42:1 molar ratio, the reaction is completed within 4 minutes. This approach is catalyst free and hence the recovery of glycerol is simpler. However, the size of reactors required would be large due to higher amount of alcohol involved. Additionally, capital costs and energy consumptions are higher.
\subsection{Emerging technologies in transesterification}
Biodiesel production using ultrasonication uses ultrasonic radiations for emulsification of immiscible liquids in transesterification. This mixing results in smaller droplets than conventional mixing which leads to more interfacial area for reaction to occur. It is efficient and energy and time saving (reaction time reduced to 5 mins and separation phase time reduced from 8 hrs to 25 mins).
Microwave enhanced transesterification uses microwave accelerated heating, unlike conventional heating, which couples directly with the molecules of the entire reaction mixture. This reduces the reaction time by 97\% and the separation time by 94\% and can be used without any pretreatment process. Yet, these emerging technologies needs to be researched with respect to industrial standards for industrial applications.




\section{Materials (Author: Arun Kumar)}
Triglycerides (Vegetable oils or animal fat) are mixed with alcohol (Bioethanol) in the ratio 1:3 in the presence alkaline catalyst (Like NaOH/KOH) to get methyl or ethyl esters (Biodiesel) in a process called transesterification.
\subsection{Raw Materials (Chemicals)}
Vegetable Oils: sunflower, rapeseed, soybean, coconut or palm.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sunflower oil: Sunflower oil is obtained from sunflower seeds. These seeds have a high output ratio that means a small quantity of seeds is enough to produce a substantial quantity of oil. Before they can be used in the production of biodiesel, they have to be refined and the wax content have to be removed. Refining of the sunflower oil takes place by neutralizing and extracting the oil using a solvent. This process removes nutrients and makes the oil unfit for human consumption but since the oil is not used for consumption but for biodiesel, this preprocessing takes importance. Dewaxing has to be done to prevent the oil from precipitating at some temperatures and losing its volatility.
	\item Rapeseed oil:
	Rapeseed oil is obtained from rapeseed with a bright yellow colored flower. Rape seeds provide a large output of oil per unit input of rapeseed when compared to sunflower seeds. The cost of growing, crushing and refining rapeseed oil is large. Hence biodiesel production is carried with used rapeseed oil as input source. This method of producing biodiesel is suitable for colder countries since rapeseed oil liquefies at a lower temperature when compared to other input sources of biodiesel, thus this process is suitable for most of the countries in Northern Europe where it can get significantly cold.
	\item Used Cooking oil and animal fats:
	The oil used for cooking ages over a period of time and is rendered unfit for cooking purposes. If we could somehow utilize this waste oil in our biodiesel plant for synthesis it would be a great benefit for the environment as well cost saving for the producer of biodiesel. In the similar manner the biological waste produced during animal butchery and waste animal fats can also be a good
	14
	source of input for the biodiesel plant. An organization called PROTELUX situated in Nevraumont in the Province of Luxembourg does the job of recycling used cooking oils and animal fats and waste obtained during butchery. They supply the required raw materials in large quantities in terms of batches.
\end{itemize}

Catalysts - Sodium hydroxide or Potassium hydroxide.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Sodium hydroxide (NaOH):
	Sodium hydroxide is a colorless crystalline solid. It is alkaline in nature. It can decompose proteins at ambient temperatures and can cause severe burns if not handled carefully. it is available in solution format since handling and packing becomes easy. NaOH is less soluble in alcohols like methanol and ethanol
	\item Potassium hydroxide (KOH):
	Potassium hydroxide can be found in pure form by reacting sodium hydroxide with impure potassium. It is sold as pellets, which becomes sticky in air because KOH has high affinity towards moisture. KOH is a strong alkali and is highly corrosive potassium hydroxide is produces a much better quality of biodiesel than Sodium hydroxide, because of its highly soluble nature. But KOH is more expensive than NaOH.	
\end{itemize}

Comparison of NaOH vs KOH:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item KOH dissolves better in alcohol than NaOH.
	\item When NaOH is used as a catalyst the byproducts obtained like glycerol turn solid or into gel form. Extraction becomes difficult in this case and also the functioning of the production equipment itself takes a hit.
	\item When KOH is used the glycerol hence obtained will be in liquid form, which is easily extractable.
	\item KOH provides a better output of biodiesel when used with high titration oils then NaOH. NaOH forms large quantities of byproducts when used with high titration oils, whereas KOH does not react so vigorously with high titration oils.
	\item Purity of KOH is obtained is less compared to NaOH. Hence more amount of KOH is needed for a particular quantity of output when compared to NaOH.
	\item KOH is more expensive than NaOH.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Physical Materials}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Electronic scale: An electronic scale is an instrument used to evaluate the weights of different materials. One class of scales are the strain gauge scales. These scales are used to measure large weights. The provide output in digital format. The principle used here is the change in resistance due to the change in length of the string because of the weight of the object in observation. The change in length may be of a string or any object which is used to suspend the weights.
	\item Test Tube:
	A test tube is a device used to observe chemical reactions between the reactants. It is also used to measure the quantity of reactants to be set aside for the reactions. Test tubes need to withstand high temperatures for certain chemical reactions to take place. Hence, they are made of borosilicate glass.
	\item Digital Magnetic Stirrer:
	This device is used to mix solutions using a wand like object. The objects would spin very rapidly inside the solution due to the change in magnetic field. The contents inside would also spin at the same velocity thus resulting in a even mix of the contents inside. They are very efficient and durable since there exits not physical contact and no moving parts. They do not even need lubrication. In our case Bio ethanol and the catalyst NaOH/KOH are mixed at 800 rpm until the catalyst completely dissolves.
	\item Erlenmeyer Flask:
	It is a type of laboratory flask which has a flat base, cone shaped body and a cylinder-shaped neck. The contents of this flask can be easily mixed without the contents getting spilled due to the cone shape. Their cylinder-shaped opening of the flask makes the use of funnels easy. They are suitable for boiling liquids.
	\item Refractometer:
	It is a device to find the refractive indices of objects. In our case the refractive index of biodiesel has to be calculated and analyzed to determine the purity of biodiesel. It is calculated as the “Ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in biodiesel”.
	\item Water bath container:
	Water bath container has preheated water maintained at a constant temperature. The reaction mixture is usually kept in a flask and placed in the container for a long time. This procedure of getting the mixture reactive is followed in case where the reactants are flammable. Since directly heating them would obviously be a bad idea. This process can be followed if the required reaction temperature is below 99.9 deg C, as water changes state after that. In our case first the mixture of bio ethanol/ catalyst is heated using water bath at 50 deg C .After the catalyst dissolves the resulting mixture is again mixed with oil and placed in water bath for 50 deg C again.
	\item Separatory Funnel:
	A separatory funnel is a glass equipment used to separate a mixture containing two liquids on the basis of the difference in their densities. The mixture of Biodiesel and the byproduct glycerol are introduced into a separation funnel to separate the biodiesel out of the mixture. The funnel has a cone shape with a blocker at the top and a tap at the bottom to separate out the mixture. The pressure build up in the funnel is handled by opening the stopper at the top periodically while removing the separated liquid at the bottom.
	\item Falling sphere viscometer:
	A viscometer evaluates the viscosity of a liquid. Falling sphere viscometer operates on the principle of frictional force exerted on a sphere due to objects with a small Reynolds number immersed in a viscous liquid. In this case a sphere is immersed in the solution and the time taken by it to travel between two set points is noted from this density of the liquid can be calculated and then using stoke’s law, the viscosity of the fluid can also be calculated.
	\item Hot plate:
	A Hot plate is a small equipment with one or more electric burners. They use the process of induction to transfer heat. One must be careful while using in a laboratory since the hot plate takes a lot of time to cool down and it also heats up very quickly, hence while heating liquids in a glass flask care must be taken to prevent the glass from overheating and in turn damaging the mantle. Hot plate is used in the current process to heat up oil to about 60 deg C.
	\item Thermometer:
	Thermometer is a device used to measure the temperature of an object. There are two main components in a thermometer. Firstly, it must have a temperature sensor to sense the target temperature and secondly it must have means to display the measured temperature to the user like a physical scale or a digital display. In the process of production of biodiesel the use of a thermometer is to monitor and display the temperature of the reaction mixture.

\section{Ethanol from garden clippings (Bioethanol) (Author: Carlos Atenkeng)}

As a cheaper and probably more sustainable way, the GF has the option of making its own ethanol from the garden clippings and grass around. The best choice of ethanol feedstocks to achieve a close to primary category will be crops with a lot of starch or sugar, such as corn or sugar beets. However, the garden clippings available are not sugar-rich, rather they are more of cellulose, so we use a different approach. This is called cellulosic ethanol. This is a brief but explicit way of getting cellulosic ethanol. This can be done either Biochemical or thermochemical. Ethanol production is monitored using an ethanol probe. An alternative method of monitoring the reaction is to measure the carbon dioxide produced (using a gas sensor) instead of the ethanol. This is a laboratory scale which can them be expanded to a larger scale.
\newline
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics{figurea-7-1.png}
	\caption {Garden clippings used for ethanol production (I2.wp.com, 2018)}
	\label{Garden clippings used for ethanol production}
\end{figure}
In a nutshell, cellulosic material (such as corn stalks, leaves, grasses, etc.) will be used as a feedstock for the production of ethanol. The cellulosic material is first pretreated (ground and heated), digested with enzymes, and then fermented with yeast. Ethanol production is monitored using an ethanol probe. \newline 
\textbf{Materials:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Cellulosic material (such as corn stalks, leaves, grasses, etc.)
	\item  Cellulase enzymes
	yeast
	\item ethanol probe
\end{itemize}[noitemsep] 
\textbf{	Sources of cellulose:}
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item  Corn stalks, leaves, and husks (stover)
	\item  Grasses grown as crops
	\item Prairie grasses
	\item Sawdust and woodchips
	\item  garden waste
	\item Other Plants
\end{itemize}

	\caption {Schematic of a Biochemical Cellulosic Ethanol Production Process (Achinas, Spyridon \& Euverink, Gert-Jan, 2016)}
	\label{Schematic of a Biochemical Cellulosic Ethanol Production Process}
\end{figure}
Procedure: \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item Sample Preparation: \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item  A ball mill grinder (or coffee grinder if ball mill grinder is not available) is used to grind feedstock into a fine powder with no large pieces remaining.
		\item 1.0 g of feedstock is measured and placed in a 50-mL centrifuge tube. The tube is labelled with the feedstock chosen.
		\item  A second 50 mL centrifuge tube is labelled as “Control”. Do not put any feedstock in this tube. \end{itemize}
\item Pretreatment:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item  A 500-mL beaker is set-up with approximately 400 mL of water on a hot plate and heated to a gentle boil.
	\item Add 25 mL of distilled water to the 2 centrifuge tubes. Swirl to mix. Put the cap on the centrifuge tubes loosely.
	\item  Put the centrifuge tubes in the beaker full of gently boiling water. Be sure that water from the water bath does not leak into the tubes. Let boil for 30 min.
	\item Let tubes cool to room temperature.
\end{itemize}
\item Enzymatic Digestion:
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item  Add 1 mL of cellulase enzyme to both tubes.
		\item  Put tubes in an incubator at 50 °C for 24 h.
		\item 3 Allow the tubes to cool to room temperature.
	\end{itemize}
\item Fermentation:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Add 1.0 g of active yeast (regular grocery store yeast is ok) to each of the centrifuge tubes. Swirl to mix.
\item Put an airlock on top of the centrifuge tube. The airlock allows CO2 to escape, keeping the pressure low in the centrifuge tube.
\item Place the centrifuge tubes in a rack and put in an incubator at 37 °C for 24 h.
\item Using an ethanol sensor, measure the ethanol concentration in the control tube.
\item Using an ethanol sensor, measure the ethanol concentration in the sample tube.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Results:}
The \% ethanol in the solution will be displayed on the handheld tablet screen using the software related to the brand of the ethanol sensor used. Representative results of the percent ethanol produced by various feedstocks. \begin{table}[h]
	\begin{center}
	
		\begin{tabular}{| c | c|}  
			\hline Feedstock &Ethanol produced \\
			\hline
			Sawdust & 0.70\% \\
			\hline
		Corn Stalks & 0.60\% \\
			\hline
		Cardboard & 1,67\% \\
			\hline
		Switchgrass & 0.37\% \\
			\hline
		Control & 0.11\% \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}
In a large scale production, there is a separation step after fermentation. That is, Stillage -- everything that's not alcohol -- settles to the bottom of a tank and is sent for processing and reuse. The alcohol stays on top and goes to distilling, which purifies it to fuel grade.
\section{Prototype Design and Setup}
The Detail mechanism of the biodiesel working model is shown below in the figure.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figurea-8-1.png}
	\caption {Biodiesel Prototype Design Model}
	\label{Biodiesel Prototype Design Model}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Storage tank:}
Used cooking oil comes from vendor is first store into the storage unit. The storage unit will be made up of PVC plastic or cast iron/Sheets.
\begin{figure}} 
	\includegraphics{figurea-8-1-1.png}
	\caption {Storage Tank}
	\label{Storage Tank}
\end{figure}
 Used cooking oil contains a lot of impure particles that should be removed before we transfer the oil into the processor. The storage drum used in this manufacturing unit has following properties.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Stores up to 55-70 Gallons.
	\item Made from Food-Grade Polyethylene.
	\item Tendency to bear 100 degrees centigrade temperature.
	\item Easily available
\end{itemize}
In the working model, we placed the storage tank on the metallic stand of 16” in height. There is an extraction valve under the storage tank. The reason behind that, heavy particles in the used oil would be settled at the bottom of the tank and make a thin layer. This layer can easily be removed by opening this valve. The metallic stand would be made up of 12 metallic bars with height of 1(1/4)’as shown in the figure.
\begin{figure} 
	\includegraphics{figurea8-1-2.png}
	\caption {Metallic stand}
	\label{Metallic stand}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Hand pump}	
Manual Hand pump at the top of the Storage drum would be used to move the oil from storage tank to filtering drum. Hand pump can be replaced by electric motor pump in order to make the system more efficient. It is only used to save electricity. This hand pump can transfer about 70ml oil in one stroke that is enough for this system.
The mechanism of the hand pump is shown in the figure
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{figurea82.png}
	\caption {Hand Pump}
	\label{Hand Pump} 
\end{figure}
\subsection{Filter Drum}
Oil in the storage tank still needs to be filtered as it contains a large amount of impurities. In order to remove the remaining impurities from this impure oil, we will filter the waste vegetable oil using nylon mesh container into that plastic barrel with a tap at the bottom. Later remove any extra water content present by allowing it to settle overnight before heating. Filtering drum can be made up of PVC/metallic sheets.
\begin{figure}[h] 
	\includegraphics{figurea8-3.png}
	\caption{Filter Drum} 
	\label{Filter Drum}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Nylon Mesh} Nylon mesh is made up of nylon which is monofilament synthetic fibers can be woven very precisely to create industrial textiles with narrow pore distribution. This precision weaving process creates fine mesh woven fabrics with apertures (hole sizes) as small as 50 micron, with a strand and thickness tolerance of +/-10%.
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.25\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics{figurea8-4.png}
	\caption {Nylon Mesh}
	\label{Nylon Mesh}
\end{wrapfigure}
The construction of plastic cloth is determined by the yarn type, yarn size and thread count. Monofilament yarns are a single continuous filament which produces a relatively smooth surface. In plain weave constructions the straight-through pores of monofilament fabrics offer minimal flow restriction and surface loading of particles as shown in the figure.
After filtering all the oil by the help of nylon mesh, let the oil settled for about 24hrs so that the remaining particles settles at the bottom of the filter drum and can be removed by using valve under at the bottom. We place the filtering drum on the stand so that the oil moves from filtering drum to the processor by the help of gravity. The height of this stand is same as storage drum.
\subsection{Processor}

The processor is normally made up of PVC plastic with 12-16” diameter and 28”in height. It is conical from the bottom for connection with pipe to add oil. 5r
This reactor is an easily assembled processor, sourced from locally acquired materials, and does not require any welding.
This processor has a capacity of processing biodiesel of about 55 gallons in one cycle. The processor stand still by the help specially designed stand for it.
As we can see the process has conical bottom which helps the
processor to connect it to the other parts of unit.

\subsection{Alcohol Storage Unit}
Alcohol is a main ingredient in processing Biodiesel.
In the process, we used ethyl alcohol.

\end{figure}
\textbf{Prerequisite}
\subsection{Identification of fat contents of waste cooking oil used:}
The waste cooking oil is exposed to very high temperatures in the presence of air and moisture which undergoes various chemical changes due to hydrolytic oxidative and thermal reactions. The various products formed during heating are polymers, dimers, oxidized triglycerides, diglycerides and fatty acids. \newline Equipment required:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item 50mm conical flask
	\item 10mm pipette
	\item 1mm disposable syringes
	\item 10ml pH bromothymol indicator solution
	\item 500ml 0.025M sodium hydroxide solution (1g/L)
	\item 500ml Isopropanol
	\item Rubber pipette filler
	\item10mm disposable syringes
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Instructions:}
Take 1 ml of oil in the flask and add 10 ml of Isopropanol using the syringes and later add 3 drops of the indicator solution. Stir the solution and add the sodium hydroxide one drop at a time using the pipette until the indicator solution changes from yellow to green. Add the drops until the green colour is maintained for at least 15 seconds. The amount of hydroxide used will be the final reading minus the initial reading, in ml.
If your amount of hydroxide used = x (ml) and the quantity of oil to process is y (liters), then the amount of solid sodium hydroxide required should be:
\newline  z = (x + 3.5) * y grams per liter.

\subsection{Selection of alkaline catalyst:}
The selection of catalyst is based on the type of waste vegetable oil obtained. The oil must have free fatty acids (FFA < 1 wt\%) and moisture content < 0.5 wt\% so that base catalyzed transesterification can be done. Alkaline catalysts like NaOH, KOH have similar properties for producing biodiesel but have few differences which may affect the selection of one of them.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item NaOH has slightly better reactivity with oil than KOH as it is typically a pure chemical.
	\item  KOH has better dissolving ability in alcohol compared to NaOH which takes quite some time to dissolve completely increasing the overall time of production of biodiesel.
	\item  NaOH is required in less quantity compared to KOH due to densities, molar ratios, etc.
	\item  Also, the cost of KOH is more than NaOH
	\item  Glycerin obtained from NaOH is thicker and is much easier to make bar soap. Whereas glycerin from KOH is liquid even at very low temperatures and can be used to make liquid or gel soap.
	\item  KOH causes alcohol to boil more violently at higher temperatures compared to NaOH
	Hence, the selection of catalyst completely depends on the environmental conditions and individual choice. We have chosen NaOH as it is economical and also does not boil violently at higher temperatures.
\end{itemize}
Quantities of chemicals used:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Oil - 100 liters
\item Ethanol - 20 liters (0.2L for every 1L of oil)
\item NaOH - z grams per liter (Amount obtained from the titration process)
\item Temperature - 50-60°C
\item Time - 1-2 hours
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedural steps:}
1. Collection of oil
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item The oil used for the biodiesel production is collected from various sources like used cooking oil from Mensa, Restaurants, etc. which is feasible for the individual. Also, using the waste cooking oil helps in reducing the efforts in disposing it properly.
	\item  Waste vegetable oil is available at much cheaper price as compared to fresh vegetable oil and also usage of waste cooking oil helps us recycle the waste to be added to the environment.
\end{enumerate}
2. Oil Filtration
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item The oil is allowed to pass through a nylon mesh placed on the filtering drum. This helps in removing large particle impurities from the oil.
	\item Later, the oil is allowed to settle so that the water content in the oil will settle at the bottom and can be removed using the valves at the bottom of the filtering drum.
\end{enumerate}
3. Mixing Reactants
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item The processor is heated to a certain temperature (30-40) to remove any water content.
	\item  Next, ethanol is transferred to the processor in the molar ratio of 6:1 according to the amount of oil used in the process.
	\item  Later, sodium hydroxide is added to the ethanol solution and it is stirred at 500 rpm using a motor pump attached besides the heater.
	\item  The catalyst must be completely dissolved in the alcohol before adding oil to the mixture.
\end{enumerate}
4. Transesterification
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Oil is added to the processor with the reactants and it is heated to a temperature of 60°C.
	\item The mixture is stirred at 800 rpm for approximately 1 hour.
	\item For every mole of oil, three moles of alcohol are required to form alkyl esters.
	\item After an hour, the mixture is allowed to settle to form separate layers of glycerol and biodiesel.
\end{enumerate}
5. Separation of glycerol
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item A small amount of pure glycerol is added to the mixture once the biodiesel and glycerol layers are separated.
	\item The glycerol obtained using sodium hydroxide is thicker and hence needs to be separated from the biodiesel properly. The pure glycerol helps in proper separation of the two layers.
	\item Now the glycerol can be removed from the processor from the outlet present near the motor pump as depicted in the model.
\end{enumerate}
6. Biodiesel washing
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Once the glycerol is separated, water is added to the biodiesel present in the processor.
	\item The mixture is stirred using motor pump at about 300 rpm and then allowed to settle.
	\item Once the water is settled, it can be removed from the valve at the bottom.
	\item This process needs to be repeated twice to completely get rid of any alcohol or catalysts present in the biodiesel
\end{enumerate}
7. Biodiesel storage
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Biodiesel can be collected from the processor and stored in a proper container for future use.
	\item It can also be used in engines directly or by mixing with petroleum fuel as it does not cause any harm to existing engines.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Safety Measures (Chemicals used) (Author: Carlos Atenkeng}
\subsection{Methanol}
Methanol as an alcohol is a suitable reactant in the chemistry of making biodiesel. However, the Green Fablab has a lot of regulations to consider, first as a project under the Rhein-Waal university of Applied Sciences and of course, owing to the fact that regulations have to be followed when dealing with chemicals of this nature. This is a detailed explanation of what to know about Methanol and the possible hazards and regulations, not forgetting first aid measures. Given that Methanol cannot be handled accordingly, it could be a good reason to go for another alcohol like Ethanol. The idea or argument to using ethanol instead is that ethanol is less toxic.
\subsection{Ethanol}
Due to its less toxicity, ethanol has been adopted as a suitable alternative to Methanol in the production of Biodiesel. Ethanol is commonly available from the fermentation of corn and other feedstocks. We plan to make ethanol from available garden clippings. The procedure for a lab scale production has been included in this document.
Note: Safety specification sheet of each chemical used are provided in the Additional Links chapter.


\section{Risk and Safety (Overall process) (Author: Carlos Atenkeng)}
Having a proper look of risks and safety involved in the operation of a biodiesel plant requires a stepwise breakdown of all processes (chemical, biological, mechanical etc.) from a Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) point of view. It is therefore very essential to know which materials are being used throughout the entire process. These materials will involve chemicals and hardware in the case of biodiesel. A good summary of a safety data sheets of chemicals has been provided as part of this report. At the time this document was written, the project was envisaged to be carried out in Germany. With that respect, the emergency number for the German police is 110; under 112, you can call the fire department or an ambulance.
\newline Some of the hazards identified from documents related to incidents in biodiesel operations have being adopted in putting this document together.
\newline \textbf{Safety Gear (Must Haves):}
The following gear should be on hand each time you produce biodiesel even if no risks have been identified after a proper assessment:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Chemical-resistant gloves (butyl rubber is best for ethanol and lye(catalyst))
	\item Chemistry goggles (indirect vented) and face shield
	\item Dust mask or cartridge respirator
	\item Eye Wash bottle with saline solution
	\item Small spray bottle with vinegar for neutralizing lye spills
	\item Access to running water
	\item Telephone in case of emergency and emergency telephone numbers 112
	\item Fire extinguishers (ABC or CO2 )
	\item Absorbent material and spill-containment supplies

\section{Environmental Impacts of Biodiesel (Author: Carlos Atenkeng)}
\textbf{Remediation of Biodiesel in the Environment:} Remediation in this context refers to removing of cleaning any environmental contaminants caused by our biodiesel production and transportation or storage processes. Even though measures have been mentioned and explained in this document to prevent biodiesel accidents and hazards, it is possible for spills and leakages to occur during transport or storage. Biodiesel is an organic fuel and spills will contaminate soil and groundwater. Since one of our aims of having a green fabrication lab is centered towards sustainability, it is important for us to also take measures to remediate any little spills that are on the ground and cannot be washed off. Biodiesel remediation can be done aerobically by aerobic degradation (oxidation).
 \newline \textbf{Soil contamination and Remediation:} Digging and dumping the contaminated soil can remove the contamination 100\% to a desirable location before it spreads to neighbouring households especially given the location of GFL. Cost problems may arise if the contaminated soil spreads and becomes wide. Digging a large quantity of soil is expensive. \newline
 \textbf{Groundwater Contamination and remediation:} Oils and biodiesel spills during storage, production and transportation can move further down to groundwater in Kamp-Lintfort if care is not taken. Constant sample collection and monitoring of groundwater around the GFL may help in early identification of contamination. Multi-phase and Dual-phase extraction of pure phase concentrations of all stakeholder chemicals in biodiesel production i.e. oils and biodiesel itself is a good technique. Spillage could lead to the formation of light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL). Plume: the plume is the portion of the water in which the contaminant dissolved. Pumping and treating contaminated water in a treatment unit is a good strategy. For instance, the treatment unit can use activated carbon.

\section{Conclusion (Author: Kasturi More)}
Biodiesel has several advantages and disadvantages which needs to be taken into consideration. The process for biodiesel production considered in this report is based on the economic and environmental aspects of the materials involved. Hence, this approach is based on the individual requirement for biodiesel production on a domestic scale.
Several researches have been done in this area with the usage of different catalysts and different oils or animal fats. Additionally, further research is carried out in this field to come up with greener materials used in the process of biodiesel production. This would help reduce the environmental and other economic issues related to the production of biodiesel. Also, there are specific crops or enzymes found in particular geographical locations. Hence, enzymatic catalysts are considered to be a greener approach in the biodiesel production but it is not economical yet for production of biodiesel on a small scale.
Therefore, catalyst used for the approach in this report is based on overall availability and economic aspect. Furthermore, there are various safety measured involved which needs to be taken care during the production of biodiesel.
