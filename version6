\section*{Abstract}
\textit{This report describes the study of various approaches for production of biodiesel. It includes the detailed research about all the chemicals used for the production of biodiesel with respect to its cost and safety guidelines. In addition to this, a detailed study of the physical materials required for the development of a biodiesel plant providing the details of vendors providing better options. The prototype design of the model is created as a 2D and 3D model with details about the actual setup of the plant with complete user manual to build the biodiesel plant on a domestic scale. The safety instructions and risks involved are mentioned separately for every component used and the entire process of biodiesel production. However, the major advantage of this process is the usage of recyclable and degradable materials for the production, thus making the entire process greener and clean. In addition to this, the advantages and drawbacks of biodiesel are explicitly mentioned to give a clear idea of the need for turning towards the usage of biofuels rather than petroleum based fuels to contribute towards the cleaner and greener environment.}

\section{Introduction (Author: Kasturi More)}
The scarcity of conventional fossil fuels, increasing emissions of pollutants, along with the increase in costs have compelled users towards non-conventional renewable energy sources as an alternative. For the vehicles and transport, biofuels are a better approach even though not the best one. As we have electric cars or hydrogen cars which is more efficient than any of the biofuels. However, implementation of these solutions will take a years together to be realized in practice. Hence, biofuels are the effective solutions than fossil fuels. Biofuels have the potential to reduce the emissions of carcinogenic compounds by about 85\%. In addition to this, biofuels are less toxic, recyclable and biodegradable as the major ingredient for production of biofuels are waste cooking oils or animal fats, etc. This makes the production of biofuels much more cost effective (SG Biofuels, 2017).
Biodiesel is an alternative fuel which is similar to conventional fossil fuels. It is a renewable, clean burning fuel which is being used nowadays instead of diesel fuels. It is made of different mix of feedstocks which includes recycled waste vegetable oil, soya bean oil, and animal fats. Biodiesel is mostly blended with petroleum diesel in the ratios of 2\% (B2), 5\% (B5), or 20\% (B20). Biodiesel which is completely pure is referred as B100. These fuels can be used in regular diesel engines without making any changes to existing engines. Biodiesel can be stored and transported using diesel fuel tanks and equipment. The major benefit of biodiesel is that it is carbon neutral which refers that there is no production of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. Being completely non-toxic and rapidly biodegradable, biodiesel spillages represents very less risks compared to fossil diesel spills. Biodiesel has higher flash point than fossil diesel hence it is safe in the event of crash (Esru.strath.ac.uk, 2017). The world energy demand is on the rise and the most feasible approach to meet this growing need is by using renewable and non-conventional alternative fuels. Biodiesel, in particular from biofuels exhibits a great potential in meeting the demand. The term biofuel is any liquid or gaseous fuels which can be used in transportation industry produced from biomass. Biofuels have numerous advantages like energy security, environmental concerns, socio-economic issues related to rural areas, foreign exchange savings, etc. It is a well-known fact that transport is majorly dependent on petroleum or fossil fuels which emit various harmful gases like carbon monoxide, methane, etc and they are harmful to the human beings and environment. Hence, biodiesel, a biofuel, is a better alternative as it helps in reducing the toxicity of emissions and can be used with current in-use vehicles. So, it is a cost effective solution for immediate application and would help in striking a balance between economic, agricultural and environmental development.
\subsection{Biodiesel}
Biodiesel is a replacement fuel for diesel to be used in diesel engines which is manufactured from plant oils i.e. soybean oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, canola oil, or recycled cooking oils, or animal fats and various other combinations of feedstocks. Used cooking oils or waste vegetable oil are plant based but may contain animal fats and are recyclable and renewable. The manufacturing process converts oils and fats into chemicals named long chain mono alkyl esters or biodiesel. These are mainly referred as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and the process is called as transesterification.

\end{figure}
\newline 
Biodiesel is an alkyl ester of a fatty acid which is made from vegetable oil but it is not a vegetable oil. If there is 100\% biodiesel, it is known as B100 which is a vegetable oil that has been transesterified to produce biodiesel. It is important that the biodiesel produced meets the ASTM biodiesel standards so it qualifies for warranties and can be sold as biodiesel to get tax credits. It was assumed that vegetable oil can be directly used as a fuel for engines but it can cause carbon deposits, poor lubrication, engine wear and hence deteriorates engine over time. This is due to high viscosity of vegetable oils compared to other fossil fuels or biodiesel. Additionally vegetable oils have natural gums that cause plugging in filters and fuel injectors. There are various options to resolve these issues like blend with petroleum diesel up to 20\%, preheat oil, mix oil with alcohols for emulsions,crack the vegetable oil, or transesterification of vegetable oil into biodiesel. The below table gives a major reason for transesterification of vegetable oil into biodiesel rather than using it directly as a fuel in diesel engines. Oil has very large viscosity which is a major concern in cold weather hence biodiesel is better alternative to fossil fuels.

\subsection{Benefits of biodiesel}
\textbf{Easy to Use}: Biodiesel can be pumped, stored and used quite similar as petroleum diesel fuel. The great advantage of biodiesel is that it can be used in currently used engines, vehicles and infrastructure without any changes. Also, biodiesel can be blended in various proportions with petroleum diesel fuel. The availability of biodiesel pumps is improving every day.
\newline
 \textbf{Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions}: The analysis conducted by Argonne National Laboratory found that B100 has 74\% less greenhouse gas emissions compared to petroleum diesel. In addition to this, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Energy jointly conducted a study and determined the net carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere using biodiesel is 78.5\% compared to petroleum diesel fuel. Also, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) reported similar details for lifecycle analysis of biodiesel from different sources. Biodiesel is the only fuel to complete U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted rigorous emissions and health effects study under the Clean Air Act successfully. This biofuel reduces effectively emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, unburned hydrocarbons, and sulfates compared to petroleum diesel fuels. Mostly biodiesel is also blended with petroleum diesel, so the emissions reductions is proportional to the amount of biodiesel present in the blend. Biodiesel helps to minimize the risk of global warming by reduction in carbon emissions to the environment. \newline \textbf{Energy Balance and Security}: The ratio of energy needed to produce, refine and distribute the fuel and the amount of energy released by the fuel when it is burned is called energy balance of fuel. This helps to determine how much renewable, a fuel is. The higher the value of this ratio, lower is the environmental impact because low fossil fuel energy is required to produce, refine and distribute the fuel. A study noted that on an average biodiesel releases 3.2 units of energy per unit of fossil fuel energy to produce it whereas diesel fuel delivers only 0.83 units of energy per unit of fossil fuel energy to produce it. Security of energy is the recent topic of concern for the government and society. Many countries are dependent on import of various fossil fuel energies like coal, oil and natural gas. If the supply of this energy is disrupted, then it would result in a threat to country’s economy with no fuel for factories, transportation, run power plants and household related needs. If domestic crops are used to produce biodiesel for fuel consumption in respective countries, one gallon of biodiesel will replace one gallon of imported crude oil and hence reduce dependency on foreign fuel supplies. Moreover, biodiesel produced in dedicated refineries would increase overall domestic refining capacity, refraining from import of expensive finished product from foreign countries.

\subsection{Drawbacks of biodiesel}
\textbf{Variation in energy amount of biodiesel:} Biodiesel can be obtained from various crops. When these oils are extracted to convert them to biofuel, the obtained biodiesel can vary in producing power. Hence, all the biofuel crops fail to produce the same amount of energy. \newline\textbf{ Unsuitable at low temperatures:} Biodiesel freezes at lower temperatures but the temperature at which it will freeze depends on the oil or fat used for its production. The effective solution for this would be to blend biodiesel with winterized diesel fuel.\newline\textbf{ Increased use of fertilizers}: Excessive demand of crops to produce biodiesel would imply more production of crops and eventually excess use of fertilizers which will have major drawbacks to the environment. This would result in land pollution and soil erosion. \newline \textbf{Food scarcity}: Majorly biofuels are produced from animal or vegetable fats which may lead to increased prices of these commodities and may even create scarcity of them in some countries. Once the crops become expensive, it would affect poor people from purchasing it. \newline\textbf{ Engine clogging}: Biodiesel helps in removing dirt from engines. On the contrary, this dirt get collected in the fuel filter and hence causes engine clogging. \newline \textbf{Regional suitability}: Few oil producing crops are not suitable to be grown in many regions. Hence, they have to be transported to particular regions which results in increased costs and emissions due to transportation. \newline\textbf{ Water shortage:} The production of more crops for biodiesel production might result in more pressure on the local water resources. This may affect the water supply for other important necessities in the region and hence, producing oil crops in water shortage regions could not be recommended. \newline \textbf{Fuel distribution}: Biodiesel is newly developed biofuels used as transportation fuel and hence is not distributed across like petroleum diesel. The infrastructure needs to be developed further to make the usage of biodiesel as a commonly preferred fuel for engines. \newline  \textbf{Nitrogen oxide emissions}: Biodiesel results in 10\% more emissions of nitrogen oxide than the petroleum fuels. Nitrogen oxide results in the formation of smog and ozone and if it dissolves in atmospheric moisture, it can cause acid rains.
\section{Background (Author: Kasturi More)}
In 1890s, Rudolf Diesel invented a diesel engine such that it can run on variety of fuels including vegetable oil. Then in the 1930s, splitting of fatty acids from glycerin in vegetable oil to create thinner products similar to petroleum diesel. G. Chavanne was granted a Belgian patent in 1937 for ethyl ester of palm oil which is now known as biodiesel. In the following year, a passenger bus was fueled with palm oil ethyl ester on the route between Brussels and Louvain. During the World War II, the petroleum fuel supplies were interrupted hence vegetable oil was used as fuel by many countries like India, Argentina, Brazil, China and Japan. Rudolf Diesel had demonstrated his engine which used peanut oil at the Paris World Fair. At that time, he and Ford believed that the biomass fuel would be the real future of his engine. However, after the end of the war, when the petroleum fuels became cheap and in abundance, vegetable oil fuel usage halted or rather forgotten. The business and the cost involved in the petroleum industries influenced the development of engines and hence their construction was done to accommodate the new cheaper fuels eradicating the potential use of biomass fuels (Articles.extension.org, 2017).
In the 1970s, an embargo on petroleum oil caused several countries to turn towards vegetable oil as a potential fuel. Eventually, it was rediscovered that straight vegetable oil could be used to run the diesel engines by the scientists in Austria, the United States, South Africa and many others. But the poor quality of fuel spray caused due to the thickness of vegetable oil resulted in damage to the engines. Hence, several experiments were conducted to convert vegetable oil to biodiesel. The word ‘biodiesel’ was used first in 1984.
The first biodiesel manufacturing plant was designed to produce fuel in 1985 in an agricultural college in Austria. Later, it has been manufactured commercially across Europe since 1992 with Germany being the largest producer. Also, in the United States, biodiesel was commercially manufactured first in 1991 in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1995, Yellowstone National Park used the fuel in a truck which had been driven several hundred thousand miles without any harm to the engine and even currently in use. The biodiesel was provided by the University of Idaho. Due to this, other national parks began using biodiesel as an alternative fuel for the vehicles. Although it became popular, uneven quality was one of the problem with biodiesel. Hence, in 2001, a standard ‘ASTM Standard D6751’ for biodiesel was published by ASTM International, one of the world’s largest voluntary standards development organizations. This standard satisfied several engine manufacturers and fleet managers with the biodiesel meeting their quality requirements.
\section{Motivation (Author: Anjali Singh)}
Fossil fuels are the major sources of energy production today and the World consumes 11 billion tonnes of oil in fossil fuels every year. It has been predicted that with the current consumption rate, fossil fuel reserves would be completely depleted by 2080 [1]. Furthermore, they are one of the prime reasons for ever increasing emissions of harmful gases in the atmosphere. There is an immediate necessity to switch to alternate fuels.
One of the alternatives for energy production which could substitute fossil fuels is Biodiesel. Biodiesel is produced through oil crops and bio wastes such as animal fat, non-edible oils and waste cooking oils. Typical oil crops such as rapeseed, soybean and palm contain large amounts of oil, which when treated, show similar properties as Diesel fuel. This treated fuel (or the Biodiesel) can be directly substituted in all the areas which use Diesel as the fuel. Biodiesel reduces emissions of carcinogenic compounds by 85\%, unburned hydrocarbons by 67\%, carbon monoxide by 48\% and particulate matter by 47\% compared to fossil fuels [2].
Biodiesel also helps in waste management, as the improper disposal of waste cooking oil could pollute the air as well as water. The pollution caused by oil crops is far more severe compared to the waste cooking oil and even the diesel fuel. Rainforests have been badly affected by palm crops, one of the main oil crops used in biodiesel production, in the Southeast Asian nations [3]. Utilization of such waste cooking oil and the oil crops to produce Biodiesel would hugely benefit waste management as well as pollution control.
The process of biodiesel production takes place through Transesterification using Methanol or Ethanol as the catalyst. Methanol is produced from natural gas, a fossil fuel, and it’s highly toxic and hazardous which makes it less suited as the catalyst. Ethanol, on the other hand, is less toxic compared to Methanol and if it’s consumed in the body, it gets converted to acetic acid (a form of vinegar). So Ethanol is used as the catalyst in the transesterification process of this research work.
\section{Literature Research (Authors: Navyashree Birappa \& Anjali Singh)}
Alejandro Sales from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden has demonstrated in his Master Thesis the production of Biodiesel from sunflower oil and ethanol using sodium hydroxide as the catalyst. He also demonstrated the change in properties of biodiesel when the quantity of the additives is changed. He concluded from his experiments that the yield of biodiesel increases with ethanol/oil ratio (Sales, 2011).
N.S. Caetano et. al., in 2012 evaluated the production of biodiesel from vegetable oil by enzymatic catalysis with ethanol as reagent and hexane as co-solvent. The evaluation results showed the best operating conditions of oil/alcohol molar ratio of 1:4, 10\% of hexane co-solvent and 48 hrs of reaction time (Caetano et al, 2012).
Another research was carried out by Surya Unni K et. al., in 2013 wherein biodiesel was produced from waste cooking oil of FFA (Free Fatty Acids) 4-5\% using methanol and sodium hydroxide as catalyst. They performed three tests by varying the reaction time and evaluated the results. The results showed that a maximum biodiesel yield of 99.09\% was obtained for 1.5 hours of reaction time, 7:1 molar ratio and 1\% of sodium hydroxide (Unni K et al, 2013).
Junaid Bin Aamir (2014) et. al., developed a low cost pilot plant for biodiesel production at domestic level. They produced the biodiesel from waste cooking oil, evaluated the results and compared them with the biodiesel standards. The yield capacity they observed was 80\% for 2-3 hours of reaction time. They also evaluated other properties and found them to meet the biodiesel standards (Bin Aamir et al, 2014).
Anne Marie Helmenstine has explained the process of producing Biodiesel from new vegetable oil using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and methanol. Experiment was carried out by mixing 3.5gm of NaOH and 200 ml of methanol for 1ltr of new vegetable oil at temperature 70°F which resulted in production of Biodiesel and Glycerin as by-products (ThoughtCo, 2017).
Zhiyou Wen et al., at James Madison University in 2017 explained the method of making own biodiesel in mainly 3 steps. First is the transesterification between triglyceride (oil) and alcohol (methanol), titration step to determine the total acidity of waste oil and in final step esterification of waste oil is carried out using product obtained from transesterification. The proportions used to carry out the experiment where 1ltr of fresh vegetable cooking oil, 250ml of pure methanol, 3.5gm of NaOH/ 5grm of KOH at temperature ~140°F ( Zhiyou Wen et al, 2017).
Iso et al., showed the alternative method of using lipase as a catalyst in the production of biodiesel. This method overcome the drawback of removal of catalyst and excessive energy requirements of chemical processes. This method is not yet been adopted industrially because of its high cost of enzyme catalyst. The methods involves immobilization of enzymes (0.6g of lipase) using 60ml of phosphate buffer and 3g of toyonite. Later transesterification reactions carried out by 3:1 ratio of triolein: alcohol using 0.1g of lipase at 220°C (Iso et al, 2001).
Musa explains the effect of alcohol i.e. methanol is the best suited than ethanol, since it possess azoetrope property and easy to recover. Also conducted several experiments and concluded that the best suited Molar ratio of triglyceride to alcohol is slight more than the Stoichiometric Molar Ratio 3:1M. That is 6:1M when methanol is used and 9:1 M when ethanol is used. Higher the molar ratio, more is the complexity of separation of biodiesel and purification process (Musa, 2016).
\section{Different methodologies for biodiesel production}
\subsection{Base catalyzed transesterification}
This method involves removal of glycerin from the fatty acids using a catalyst such as sodium or potassium hydroxide and replace it with an anhydrous alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol (preferably small chain alcohols). This produces methyl or ethyl ester and glycerol, a valuable by product used for making soaps, cosmetics, etc.
It is an economical method of producing biodiesel as it gives over 98\% yield and has direct conversion to biodiesel without any intermediates. Also, it requires low temperature and pressure with no specific material requirements to build the model.
\subsection{Acid catalyzed transesterification}
Due to the limitations of base catalyzed transesterification with its sensitivity towards the purity of reactants and moisture and FFA content of used oil. Acid catalyzed transesterification are insensitive to FFA content and can simultaneously catalyze both esterification and transesterification process. Mainly used inorganic acidic catalysts are hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, and sulfonated organic acids.
However, acid catalysts have relatively slower reaction rate and requires higher alcohol to oil ratios for better yield of biodiesel. Other disadvantages include acidic effluent, non-reusable catalyst and expensive equipment required.
\subsection{Two step transesterification}
The drawbacks of saponification in base catalyzed and slow reaction time in acid catalyzed transesterification have compelled researchers to adopt two step transesterification. In the first step, esterification of FFA is performed using acid to decrease the FFAs level less than 1\%. In the second step, transesterification of obtained oil is performed using alkaline catalyst. Hence, this process involved advantages of non-acidic waste water, high efficiency, low equipment cost.
Although, it has many advantages, this process faces the problem of catalyst removal in both stages. However, the effect of acidic catalyst in the first step can be neutralized by adding extra alkaline catalyst in the second step. But, extra use of alkaline catalyst eventually increases the cost of biodiesel.
\subsection{Transesterification using heterogeneous catalysts}
Heterogeneous catalysts have a basic advantage of easy separation from the reactions and reusability. Hence, it makes the process green. This process does not require any catalyst recovery or aqueous treatment steps as the purification steps are very simple and yield high amount of alkyl esters approximately equal to the theoretical value. Glycerin, the byproduct obtained is highly pure (98\%) and does not contain any salt contaminants. In addition to this, there is no soap formation due to the use of heterogeneous catalysts while solid acid catalysts have strong capability to replace liquid acids removing the corrosion problems and environment threat posed to them.
Acid zeolites, heteropolyacids, ion-exchange resins and immobilized sulfonic acids and sulfated zirconia and mixed metal oxides are some of the heterogeneous catalysts. Although there are advantages of being easily separated from products, recyclable, good stability and environmental friendly, there needs to be further research conducted expecting positive results in this direction.
\subsection{Enzymatic transesterification}
Currently, enzymatic catalysts are used in commercial production of biodiesel fuel. It is highly efficient, highly selective, less energy consumption, and produces less side products or waste. The enzymatic reaction is based on the use of biocatalysts as lipases which catalyze the hydrolysis of fats and vegetable oils with formation of glycerol and linear chain esters.
This approach is said to be environmental friendly, commonly considered a green reaction. However, the cost of final enzymatic product poses problems as compared to economical chemical catalysts. Hence, there is a need for further research to be done to implement this for industrial production of biodiesel.
\subsection{Non-catalytic transesterification}
This approach was developed to solve the problem of reaction limitation lag caused by poor methanol and oil miscibility. Tetrahydrofuran, a co-solvent was chosen due to its boiling point close to methanol. With 6:1 methanol to oil ratio, 1.25 volume of this co-solvent per volume of methanol produced an oil dominant one phase system in which methanolysis speeds up without agitation and at ambient temperatures and pressures. There are no catalyst residues in esters or glycerol.Another non-catalytic method is using methanol at very high temperature and pressure called as supercritical methanol. At 350-400 C and >80 atm and 42:1 molar ratio, the reaction is completed within 4 minutes. This approach is catalyst free and hence the recovery of glycerol is simpler. However, the size of reactors required would be large due to higher amount of alcohol involved. Additionally, capital costs and energy consumptions are higher.
\subsection{Emerging technologies in transesterification}
Biodiesel production using ultrasonication uses ultrasonic radiations for emulsification of immiscible liquids in transesterification. This mixing results in smaller droplets than conventional mixing which leads to more interfacial area for reaction to occur. It is efficient and energy and time saving (reaction time reduced to 5 mins and separation phase time reduced from 8 hrs to 25 mins).
Microwave enhanced transesterification uses microwave accelerated heating, unlike conventional heating, which couples directly with the molecules of the entire reaction mixture. This reduces the reaction time by 97\% and the separation time by 94\% and can be used without any pretreatment process. Yet, these emerging technologies needs to be researched with respect to industrial standards for industrial applications.




\section{Materials (Author: Arun Kumar)}
Triglycerides (Vegetable oils or animal fat) are mixed with alcohol (Bioethanol) in the ratio 1:3 in the presence alkaline catalyst (Like NaOH/KOH) to get methyl or ethyl esters (Biodiesel) in a process called transesterification.
\subsection{Raw Materials (Chemicals)}
Vegetable Oils: sunflower, rapeseed, soybean, coconut or palm.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sunflower oil: Sunflower oil is obtained from sunflower seeds. These seeds have a high output ratio that means a small quantity of seeds is enough to produce a substantial quantity of oil. Before they can be used in the production of biodiesel, they have to be refined and the wax content have to be removed. Refining of the sunflower oil takes place by neutralizing and extracting the oil using a solvent. This process removes nutrients and makes the oil unfit for human consumption but since the oil is not used for consumption but for biodiesel, this preprocessing takes importance. Dewaxing has to be done to prevent the oil from precipitating at some temperatures and losing its volatility.
	\item Rapeseed oil:
	Rapeseed oil is obtained from rapeseed with a bright yellow colored flower. Rape seeds provide a large output of oil per unit input of rapeseed when compared to sunflower seeds. The cost of growing, crushing and refining rapeseed oil is large. Hence biodiesel production is carried with used rapeseed oil as input source. This method of producing biodiesel is suitable for colder countries since rapeseed oil liquefies at a lower temperature when compared to other input sources of biodiesel, thus this process is suitable for most of the countries in Northern Europe where it can get significantly cold.
	\item Used Cooking oil and animal fats:
	The oil used for cooking ages over a period of time and is rendered unfit for cooking purposes. If we could somehow utilize this waste oil in our biodiesel plant for synthesis it would be a great benefit for the environment as well cost saving for the producer of biodiesel. In the similar manner the biological waste produced during animal butchery and waste animal fats can also be a good
	14
	source of input for the biodiesel plant. An organization called PROTELUX situated in Nevraumont in the Province of Luxembourg does the job of recycling used cooking oils and animal fats and waste obtained during butchery. They supply the required raw materials in large quantities in terms of batches.
\end{itemize}

Catalysts - Sodium hydroxide or Potassium hydroxide.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Sodium hydroxide (NaOH):
	Sodium hydroxide is a colorless crystalline solid. It is alkaline in nature. It can decompose proteins at ambient temperatures and can cause severe burns if not handled carefully. it is available in solution format since handling and packing becomes easy. NaOH is less soluble in alcohols like methanol and ethanol
	\item Potassium hydroxide (KOH):
	Potassium hydroxide can be found in pure form by reacting sodium hydroxide with impure potassium. It is sold as pellets, which becomes sticky in air because KOH has high affinity towards moisture. KOH is a strong alkali and is highly corrosive potassium hydroxide is produces a much better quality of biodiesel than Sodium hydroxide, because of its highly soluble nature. But KOH is more expensive than NaOH.	
\end{itemize}

Comparison of NaOH vs KOH:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item KOH dissolves better in alcohol than NaOH.
	\item When NaOH is used as a catalyst the byproducts obtained like glycerol turn solid or into gel form. Extraction becomes difficult in this case and also the functioning of the production equipment itself takes a hit.
	\item When KOH is used the glycerol hence obtained will be in liquid form, which is easily extractable.
	\item KOH provides a better output of biodiesel when used with high titration oils then NaOH. NaOH forms large quantities of byproducts when used with high titration oils, whereas KOH does not react so vigorously with high titration oils.
	\item Purity of KOH is obtained is less compared to NaOH. Hence more amount of KOH is needed for a particular quantity of output when compared to NaOH.
	\item KOH is more expensive than NaOH.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Physical Materials}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Electronic scale: An electronic scale is an instrument used to evaluate the weights of different materials. One class of scales are the strain gauge scales. These scales are used to measure large weights. The provide output in digital format. The principle used here is the change in resistance due to the change in length of the string because of the weight of the object in observation. The change in length may be of a string or any object which is used to suspend the weights.
	\item Test Tube:
	A test tube is a device used to observe chemical reactions between the reactants. It is also used to measure the quantity of reactants to be set aside for the reactions. Test tubes need to withstand high temperatures for certain chemical reactions to take place. Hence, they are made of borosilicate glass.
	\item Digital Magnetic Stirrer:
	This device is used to mix solutions using a wand like object. The objects would spin very rapidly inside the solution due to the change in magnetic field. The contents inside would also spin at the same velocity thus resulting in a even mix of the contents inside. They are very efficient and durable since there exits not physical contact and no moving parts. They do not even need lubrication. In our case Bio ethanol and the catalyst NaOH/KOH are mixed at 800 rpm until the catalyst completely dissolves.
	\item Erlenmeyer Flask:
	It is a type of laboratory flask which has a flat base, cone shaped body and a cylinder-shaped neck. The contents of this flask can be easily mixed without the contents getting spilled due to the cone shape. Their cylinder-shaped opening of the flask makes the use of funnels easy. They are suitable for boiling liquids.
	\item Refractometer:
	It is a device to find the refractive indices of objects. In our case the refractive index of biodiesel has to be calculated and analyzed to determine the purity of biodiesel. It is calculated as the “Ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in biodiesel”.
	\item Water bath container:
	Water bath container has preheated water maintained at a constant temperature. The reaction mixture is usually kept in a flask and placed in the container for a long time. This procedure of getting the mixture reactive is followed in case where the reactants are flammable. Since directly heating them would obviously be a bad idea. This process can be followed if the required reaction temperature is below 99.9 deg C, as water changes state after that. In our case first the mixture of bio ethanol/ catalyst is heated using water bath at 50 deg C .After the catalyst dissolves the resulting mixture is again mixed with oil and placed in water bath for 50 deg C again.
	\item Separatory Funnel:
	A separatory funnel is a glass equipment used to separate a mixture containing two liquids on the basis of the difference in their densities. The mixture of Biodiesel and the byproduct glycerol are introduced into a separation funnel to separate the biodiesel out of the mixture. The funnel has a cone shape with a blocker at the top and a tap at the bottom to separate out the mixture. The pressure build up in the funnel is handled by opening the stopper at the top periodically while removing the separated liquid at the bottom.
	\item Falling sphere viscometer:
	A viscometer evaluates the viscosity of a liquid. Falling sphere viscometer operates on the principle of frictional force exerted on a sphere due to objects with a small Reynolds number immersed in a viscous liquid. In this case a sphere is immersed in the solution and the time taken by it to travel between two set points is noted from this density of the liquid can be calculated and then using stoke’s law, the viscosity of the fluid can also be calculated.
	\item Hot plate:
	A Hot plate is a small equipment with one or more electric burners. They use the process of induction to transfer heat. One must be careful while using in a laboratory since the hot plate takes a lot of time to cool down and it also heats up very quickly, hence while heating liquids in a glass flask care must be taken to prevent the glass from overheating and in turn damaging the mantle. Hot plate is used in the current process to heat up oil to about 60 deg C.
	\item Thermometer:
	Thermometer is a device used to measure the temperature of an object. There are two main components in a thermometer. Firstly, it must have a temperature sensor to sense the target temperature and secondly it must have means to display the measured temperature to the user like a physical scale or a digital display. In the process of production of biodiesel the use of a thermometer is to monitor and display the temperature of the reaction mixture.

\section{Ethanol from garden clippings (Bioethanol) (Author: Carlos Atenkeng)}

As a cheaper and probably more sustainable way, the GF has the option of making its own ethanol from the garden clippings and grass around. The best choice of ethanol feedstocks to achieve a close to primary category will be crops with a lot of starch or sugar, such as corn or sugar beets. However, the garden clippings available are not sugar-rich, rather they are more of cellulose, so we use a different approach. This is called cellulosic ethanol. This is a brief but explicit way of getting cellulosic ethanol. This can be done either Biochemical or thermochemical. Ethanol production is monitored using an ethanol probe. An alternative method of monitoring the reaction is to measure the carbon dioxide produced (using a gas sensor) instead of the ethanol. This is a laboratory scale which can them be expanded to a larger scale.
\newline
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics{figurea-7-1.png}
	\caption {Garden clippings used for ethanol production (I2.wp.com, 2018)}
	\label{Garden clippings used for ethanol production}
\end{figure}
In a nutshell, cellulosic material (such as corn stalks, leaves, grasses, etc.) will be used as a feedstock for the production of ethanol. The cellulosic material is first pretreated (ground and heated), digested with enzymes, and then fermented with yeast. Ethanol production is monitored using an ethanol probe. \newline 
\textbf{Materials:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Cellulosic material (such as corn stalks, leaves, grasses, etc.)
	\item  Cellulase enzymes
	yeast
	\item ethanol probe
\end{itemize}[noitemsep] 
\textbf{	Sources of cellulose:}
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item  Corn stalks, leaves, and husks (stover)
	\item  Grasses grown as crops
	\item Prairie grasses
	\item Sawdust and woodchips
	\item  garden waste
	\item Other Plants
\end{itemize}

	\caption {Schematic of a Biochemical Cellulosic Ethanol Production Process (Achinas, Spyridon \& Euverink, Gert-Jan, 2016)}
	\label{Schematic of a Biochemical Cellulosic Ethanol Production Process}
\end{figure}
Procedure: \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
		\item Sample Preparation: \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item  A ball mill grinder (or coffee grinder if ball mill grinder is not available) is used to grind feedstock into a fine powder with no large pieces remaining.
		\item 1.0 g of feedstock is measured and placed in a 50-mL centrifuge tube. The tube is labelled with the feedstock chosen.
		\item  A second 50 mL centrifuge tube is labelled as “Control”. Do not put any feedstock in this tube. \end{itemize}
\item Pretreatment:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item  A 500-mL beaker is set-up with approximately 400 mL of water on a hot plate and heated to a gentle boil.
	\item Add 25 mL of distilled water to the 2 centrifuge tubes. Swirl to mix. Put the cap on the centrifuge tubes loosely.
	\item  Put the centrifuge tubes in the beaker full of gently boiling water. Be sure that water from the water bath does not leak into the tubes. Let boil for 30 min.
	\item Let tubes cool to room temperature.
\end{itemize}
\item Enzymatic Digestion:
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item  Add 1 mL of cellulase enzyme to both tubes.
		\item  Put tubes in an incubator at 50 °C for 24 h.
		\item 3 Allow the tubes to cool to room temperature.
	\end{itemize}
\item Fermentation:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Add 1.0 g of active yeast (regular grocery store yeast is ok) to each of the centrifuge tubes. Swirl to mix.
\item Put an airlock on top of the centrifuge tube. The airlock allows CO2 to escape, keeping the pressure low in the centrifuge tube.
\item Place the centrifuge tubes in a rack and put in an incubator at 37 °C for 24 h.
\item Using an ethanol sensor, measure the ethanol concentration in the control tube.
\item Using an ethanol sensor, measure the ethanol concentration in the sample tube.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Results:}
The \% ethanol in the solution will be displayed on the handheld tablet screen using the software related to the brand of the ethanol sensor used. Representative results of the percent ethanol produced by various feedstocks. \begin{table}[h]
	\begin{center}
	
		\begin{tabular}{| c | c|}  
			\hline Feedstock &Ethanol produced \\
			\hline
			Sawdust & 0.70\% \\
			\hline
		Corn Stalks & 0.60\% \\
			\hline
		Cardboard & 1,67\% \\
			\hline
		Switchgrass & 0.37\% \\
			\hline
		Control & 0.11\% \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}
In a large scale production, there is a separation step after fermentation. That is, Stillage -- everything that's not alcohol -- settles to the bottom of a tank and is sent for processing and reuse. The alcohol stays on top and goes to distilling, which purifies it to fuel grade.
\section{Prototype Design and Setup}
The Detail mechanism of the biodiesel working model is shown below in the figure.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figurea-8-1.png}
	\caption {Biodiesel Prototype Design Model}
	\label{Biodiesel Prototype Design Model}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Storage tank:}
Used cooking oil comes from vendor is first store into the storage unit. The storage unit will be made up of PVC plastic or cast iron/Sheets.
\begin{figure} 
	\includegraphics{figurea-8-1-1.png}
	\caption {Storage Tank}
	\label{Storage Tank} 
\end{figure}

 Used cooking oil contains a lot of impure particles that should be removed before we transfer the oil into the processor. The storage drum used in this manufacturing unit has following properties.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Stores up to 55-70 Gallons.
	\item Made from Food-Grade Polyethylene.
	\item Tendency to bear 100 degrees centigrade temperature.
	\item Easily available
\end{itemize}
In the working model, we placed the storage tank on the metallic stand of 16” in height. There is an extraction valve under the storage tank. The reason behind that, heavy particles in the used oil would be settled at the bottom of the tank and make a thin layer. This layer can easily be removed by opening this valve. The metallic stand would be made up of 12 metallic bars with height of 1(1/4)’as shown in the figure.
\begin{figure} 
	\includegraphics{figurea8-1-2.png}
	\caption {Metallic stand}
	\label{Metallic stand}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Hand pump}	
Manual Hand pump at the top of the Storage drum would be used to move the oil from storage tank to filtering drum. Hand pump can be replaced by electric motor pump in order to make the system more efficient. It is only used to save electricity. This hand pump can transfer about 70ml oil in one stroke that is enough for this system.
The mechanism of the hand pump is shown in the figure
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{figurea82.png}
	\caption {Hand Pump}
	\label{Hand Pump} 
\end{figure}
\subsection{Filter Drum}
\begin{figure}[h] 
	\includegraphics{figurea8-3.png}
	\caption{Filter Drum} 
	\label{Filter Drum}
\end{figure}
Oil in the storage tank still needs to be filtered as it contains a large amount of impurities. In order to remove the remaining impurities from this impure oil, we will filter the waste vegetable oil using nylon mesh container into that plastic barrel with a tap at the bottom. Later remove any extra water content present by allowing it to settle overnight before heating. Filtering drum can be made up of PVC/metallic sheets.

\subsection{Nylon Mesh} 
\begin{figure} 
	\includegraphics{figurea8-4.png}
	\caption {Nylon Mesh}
	\label{Nylon Mesh}
\end{figure}
Nylon mesh is made up of nylon which is monofilament synthetic fibers can be woven very precisely to create industrial textiles with narrow pore distribution. This precision weaving process creates fine mesh woven fabrics with apertures (hole sizes) as small as 50 micron, with a strand and thickness tolerance of +/-10%.

The construction of plastic cloth is determined by the yarn type, yarn size and thread count. Monofilament yarns are a single continuous filament which produces a relatively smooth surface. In plain weave constructions the straight-through pores of monofilament fabrics offer minimal flow restriction and surface loading of particles as shown in the figure.
After filtering all the oil by the help of nylon mesh, let the oil settled for about 24hrs so that the remaining particles settles at the bottom of the filter drum and can be removed by using valve under at the bottom. We place the filtering drum on the stand so that the oil moves from filtering drum to the processor by the help of gravity. The height of this stand is same as storage drum.
\subsection{Processor}

The processor is normally made up of PVC plastic with 12-16” diameter and 28”in height. It is conical from the bottom for connection with pipe to add oil. 5r
This reactor is an easily assembled processor, sourced from locally acquired materials, and does not require any welding.
This processor has a capacity of processing biodiesel of about 55 gallons in one cycle. The processor stand still by the help specially designed stand for it.
As we can see the process has conical bottom which helps the
processor to connect it to the other parts of unit.

\subsection{Alcohol Storage Unit}
Alcohol is a main ingredient in processing Biodiesel.
In the process, we used ethyl alcohol.

\end{figure}
\textbf{Prerequisite}
\subsection{Identification of fat contents of waste cooking oil used:}
The waste cooking oil is exposed to very high temperatures in the presence of air and moisture which undergoes various chemical changes due to hydrolytic oxidative and thermal reactions. The various products formed during heating are polymers, dimers, oxidized triglycerides, diglycerides and fatty acids. \newline Equipment required:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item 50mm conical flask
	\item 10mm pipette
	\item 1mm disposable syringes
	\item 10ml pH bromothymol indicator solution
	\item 500ml 0.025M sodium hydroxide solution (1g/L)
	\item 500ml Isopropanol
	\item Rubber pipette filler
	\item10mm disposable syringes
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Instructions:}
Take 1 ml of oil in the flask and add 10 ml of Isopropanol using the syringes and later add 3 drops of the indicator solution. Stir the solution and add the sodium hydroxide one drop at a time using the pipette until the indicator solution changes from yellow to green. Add the drops until the green colour is maintained for at least 15 seconds. The amount of hydroxide used will be the final reading minus the initial reading, in ml.
If your amount of hydroxide used = x (ml) and the quantity of oil to process is y (liters), then the amount of solid sodium hydroxide required should be:
\newline  z = (x + 3.5) * y grams per liter.

\subsection{Selection of alkaline catalyst:}
The selection of catalyst is based on the type of waste vegetable oil obtained. The oil must have free fatty acids (FFA < 1 wt\%) and moisture content < 0.5 wt\% so that base catalyzed transesterification can be done. Alkaline catalysts like NaOH, KOH have similar properties for producing biodiesel but have few differences which may affect the selection of one of them.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item NaOH has slightly better reactivity with oil than KOH as it is typically a pure chemical.
	\item  KOH has better dissolving ability in alcohol compared to NaOH which takes quite some time to dissolve completely increasing the overall time of production of biodiesel.
	\item  NaOH is required in less quantity compared to KOH due to densities, molar ratios, etc.
	\item  Also, the cost of KOH is more than NaOH
	\item  Glycerin obtained from NaOH is thicker and is much easier to make bar soap. Whereas glycerin from KOH is liquid even at very low temperatures and can be used to make liquid or gel soap.
	\item  KOH causes alcohol to boil more violently at higher temperatures compared to NaOH
	Hence, the selection of catalyst completely depends on the environmental conditions and individual choice. We have chosen NaOH as it is economical and also does not boil violently at higher temperatures.
\end{itemize}
Quantities of chemicals used:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Oil - 100 liters
\item Ethanol - 20 liters (0.2L for every 1L of oil)
\item NaOH - z grams per liter (Amount obtained from the titration process)
\item Temperature - 50-60°C
\item Time - 1-2 hours
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedural steps:}
1. Collection of oil
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item The oil used for the biodiesel production is collected from various sources like used cooking oil from Mensa, Restaurants, etc. which is feasible for the individual. Also, using the waste cooking oil helps in reducing the efforts in disposing it properly.
	\item  Waste vegetable oil is available at much cheaper price as compared to fresh vegetable oil and also usage of waste cooking oil helps us recycle the waste to be added to the environment.
\end{enumerate}
2. Oil Filtration
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item The oil is allowed to pass through a nylon mesh placed on the filtering drum. This helps in removing large particle impurities from the oil.
	\item Later, the oil is allowed to settle so that the water content in the oil will settle at the bottom and can be removed using the valves at the bottom of the filtering drum.
\end{enumerate}
3. Mixing Reactants
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item The processor is heated to a certain temperature (30-40) to remove any water content.
	\item  Next, ethanol is transferred to the processor in the molar ratio of 6:1 according to the amount of oil used in the process.
	\item  Later, sodium hydroxide is added to the ethanol solution and it is stirred at 500 rpm using a motor pump attached besides the heater.
	\item  The catalyst must be completely dissolved in the alcohol before adding oil to the mixture.
\end{enumerate}
4. Transesterification
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Oil is added to the processor with the reactants and it is heated to a temperature of 60°C.
	\item The mixture is stirred at 800 rpm for approximately 1 hour.
	\item For every mole of oil, three moles of alcohol are required to form alkyl esters.
	\item After an hour, the mixture is allowed to settle to form separate layers of glycerol and biodiesel.
\end{enumerate}
5. Separation of glycerol
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item A small amount of pure glycerol is added to the mixture once the biodiesel and glycerol layers are separated.
	\item The glycerol obtained using sodium hydroxide is thicker and hence needs to be separated from the biodiesel properly. The pure glycerol helps in proper separation of the two layers.
	\item Now the glycerol can be removed from the processor from the outlet present near the motor pump as depicted in the model.
\end{enumerate}
6. Biodiesel washing
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Once the glycerol is separated, water is added to the biodiesel present in the processor.
	\item The mixture is stirred using motor pump at about 300 rpm and then allowed to settle.
	\item Once the water is settled, it can be removed from the valve at the bottom.
	\item This process needs to be repeated twice to completely get rid of any alcohol or catalysts present in the biodiesel
\end{enumerate}
7. Biodiesel storage
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item Biodiesel can be collected from the processor and stored in a proper container for future use.
	\item It can also be used in engines directly or by mixing with petroleum fuel as it does not cause any harm to existing engines.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Safety Measures (Chemicals used) (Author: Carlos Atenkeng}
\subsection{Methanol}
Methanol as an alcohol is a suitable reactant in the chemistry of making biodiesel. However, the Green Fablab has a lot of regulations to consider, first as a project under the Rhein-Waal university of Applied Sciences and of course, owing to the fact that regulations have to be followed when dealing with chemicals of this nature. This is a detailed explanation of what to know about Methanol and the possible hazards and regulations, not forgetting first aid measures. Given that Methanol cannot be handled accordingly, it could be a good reason to go for another alcohol like Ethanol. The idea or argument to using ethanol instead is that ethanol is less toxic.
\subsection{Ethanol}
Due to its less toxicity, ethanol has been adopted as a suitable alternative to Methanol in the production of Biodiesel. Ethanol is commonly available from the fermentation of corn and other feedstocks. We plan to make ethanol from available garden clippings. The procedure for a lab scale production has been included in this document.
Note: Safety specification sheet of each chemical used are provided in the Additional Links chapter.


\section{Risk and Safety (Overall process) (Author: Carlos Atenkeng)}
Having a proper look of risks and safety involved in the operation of a biodiesel plant requires a stepwise breakdown of all processes (chemical, biological, mechanical etc.) from a Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) point of view. It is therefore very essential to know which materials are being used throughout the entire process. These materials will involve chemicals and hardware in the case of biodiesel. A good summary of a safety data sheets of chemicals has been provided as part of this report. At the time this document was written, the project was envisaged to be carried out in Germany. With that respect, the emergency number for the German police is 110; under 112, you can call the fire department or an ambulance.
\newline Some of the hazards identified from documents related to incidents in biodiesel operations have being adopted in putting this document together.
\newline \textbf{Safety Gear (Must Haves):}
The following gear should be on hand each time you produce biodiesel even if no risks have been identified after a proper assessment:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Chemical-resistant gloves (butyl rubber is best for ethanol and lye(catalyst))
	\item Chemistry goggles (indirect vented) and face shield
	\item Dust mask or cartridge respirator
	\item Eye Wash bottle with saline solution
	\item Small spray bottle with vinegar for neutralizing lye spills
	\item Access to running water
	\item Telephone in case of emergency and emergency telephone numbers 112
	\item Fire extinguishers (ABC or CO2 )
	\item Absorbent material and spill-containment supplies

\section{Environmental Impacts of Biodiesel (Author: Carlos Atenkeng)}
\textbf{Remediation of Biodiesel in the Environment:} Remediation in this context refers to removing of cleaning any environmental contaminants caused by our biodiesel production and transportation or storage processes. Even though measures have been mentioned and explained in this document to prevent biodiesel accidents and hazards, it is possible for spills and leakages to occur during transport or storage. Biodiesel is an organic fuel and spills will contaminate soil and groundwater. Since one of our aims of having a green fabrication lab is centered towards sustainability, it is important for us to also take measures to remediate any little spills that are on the ground and cannot be washed off. Biodiesel remediation can be done aerobically by aerobic degradation (oxidation).
 \newline \textbf{Soil contamination and Remediation:} Digging and dumping the contaminated soil can remove the contamination 100\% to a desirable location before it spreads to neighbouring households especially given the location of GFL. Cost problems may arise if the contaminated soil spreads and becomes wide. Digging a large quantity of soil is expensive. \newline
 \textbf{Groundwater Contamination and remediation:} Oils and biodiesel spills during storage, production and transportation can move further down to groundwater in Kamp-Lintfort if care is not taken. Constant sample collection and monitoring of groundwater around the GFL may help in early identification of contamination. Multi-phase and Dual-phase extraction of pure phase concentrations of all stakeholder chemicals in biodiesel production i.e. oils and biodiesel itself is a good technique. Spillage could lead to the formation of light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL). Plume: the plume is the portion of the water in which the contaminant dissolved. Pumping and treating contaminated water in a treatment unit is a good strategy. For instance, the treatment unit can use activated carbon.

\section{Conclusion (Author: Kasturi More)}
Biodiesel has several advantages and disadvantages which needs to be taken into consideration. The process for biodiesel production considered in this report is based on the economic and environmental aspects of the materials involved. Hence, this approach is based on the individual requirement for biodiesel production on a domestic scale.
Several researches have been done in this area with the usage of different catalysts and different oils or animal fats. Additionally, further research is carried out in this field to come up with greener materials used in the process of biodiesel production. This would help reduce the environmental and other economic issues related to the production of biodiesel. Also, there are specific crops or enzymes found in particular geographical locations. Hence, enzymatic catalysts are considered to be a greener approach in the biodiesel production but it is not economical yet for production of biodiesel on a small scale.
Therefore, catalyst used for the approach in this report is based on overall availability and economic aspect. Furthermore, there are various safety measured involved which needs to be taken care during the production of biodiesel.

\section{Aim (Nancy Bellingan 19575)}
Biogas is becoming more and more present in Germany’s energy production net, with more than nine thousand production plants present all over the country and it’s leading Europe as main biogas produce with 33 TWh yearly gross production at 2017 and a year cut of 700 tons on CO2 emissions [Fachverband Biogas 2017]. The strength of biogas is in the usage of local bio-wastes cutting on the transportation and direct applications of the energy or fuel produced. This manual has the aim to give an overview on biogas applications and principles as well as describing a homemade biogas plant model, its materials and possible configurations and how to operate and maintain it in conformity with safety regulations to guarantee a controlled experience.

\section{Introduction to biogas technology (Taiwo Damilola 18610) }
Biogas is defined as the mixture of gases produced by the bacterial breakdown of biomass under anaerobic conditions. The biomass consists of three categories: (1) Farm organic matter such as feed waste, energy crops, liquid manure, harvest waste; (2) Household waste such as market waste, expired food or food waste; (3) Industrial by-products such as wastes from fat separators, glycerine, and the by-products of food processing. In the airtight digesters, the organic matter is converted to biogas by bacteria in several steps (Wellinger et al 2013).

As it is with fossil natural gas, the first main component of biogas that ascertains the energy content of the gas is flammable methane (CH$_{4}$). As seen in the figure below, the methane content of the biogas changes between 50\% and 75\% depending on the substrate the biogas plant will digest. The second main component of biogas is carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$). The content of the (CO$_{2}$) in biogas fluctuates between 25\% and 50\%. Other components of biogas includes oxygen, traces of sulfur (S$_{2}$) and hydrogen sulfide (H$_{2}$S) and also water (H$_{2}$O).
\newline In a biogas treatment, biogas can be compressed to biomethane with approximately 98\% of methane, which has the same properties as natural gas. Thus, biogas and biomethane produced from biogas are flexible renewable fuels that can be stored. In the context of sustainable energy supply, biogas and biomethane are important functions because electricity, motor fuel, and heat can be produced from them.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics{figb1.png}
	\caption {Composition of biogas [www.biogasindia.in/employment.htm]}
	\label{Composition of biogas [www.biogasindia.in/employment.htm]}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sources of biogas feedstock (Taiwo Damilola 18610)}
Anaerobic digestion of manure and other feedstocks results in the production of biogas which are important functions to make energy for farms. Therefore, biogas can be generated by using different organic matter as a feedstock in anaerobic digesters. The feedstock used in the  process must contain appropriate moisture contents depending on the operation and the design of the system. However, there are several limitations (legal, engineering and scientific) to what can be added successfully to a digester (Kirk, 2014).
\subsubsection{Feedstocks for Anaerobic Digestion}
Feedstocks used in anaerobic digestion are obtained primarily from one major source as shown in figure B.2.
\newline 
In the past, anaerobic digestion was mostly associated with the treatment of animal (pig, cattle, poultry) manure and sewage sludge from aerobic wastewater treatment plants(Steffen et al 1998, pp. 2). The energy production potential of feedstocks varies depending on the type, level of processing/pretreatment and concentration of biodegradable material. \\
However, the increased environmental consciousness, accompanied by the demand for new waste management strategies and renewable energy forms, broadened the field of applications for anaerobic digestion and hence introduced industrial and municipal wastes as well.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics{figb2.png}
	\caption {An organics operating system for the future [Renewable Energy World http://bit.ly/2C2EeY3]}
	\label{An organics operating system for the future [Renewable Energy World http://bit.ly/2C2EeY3]}
\end{figure}
Recent concerns over landfilling of solid wastes stimulated engineers to consider new approaches to their treatment before disposal. For example solid and semi-solid wastes such as the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), currently commonly disposed of to landfills or aerobically composted, may be treated anaerobically, saving landfill space and converting the organic material partially to biogas energy  (Steffen et al 1998, pp. 2).

\subsubsection{Agricultural Wastes Suitable For Anaerobic Digestion}
Agricultural waste represents one of the largest anthropogenic sources of methane
present in the atmosphere. Anaerobic digesters can turn these wastes into biogas as
renewable energy, containing at least 50\% of methane, and the solid residues into
fertilizers rich in nutrients. (Merlin and Boileau 2013, pp. 1).
\\
Listed below are agricultural wastes that can be commonly used and suitable in anaerobic digesters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pig slurry: Up to six varieties of the different types of animal housing are commonly in use, resulting in large variations of total solids (2 - 10 \%) and organic dry matter content in manure. The excrements from pigs, particularly in units with more than 1000 animals, are commonly collected as a liquid slurry. In most cases, pigs are kept in feedlots with open floors, where the excrements are collected through slots with high amounts of liquid. The dilution of the feedstock resulting in 2 - 5 \% TS makes the application of a digester system often uneconomic. In some cases, the slurry is collected using scraper systems resulting in higher dry matter contents of 5 - 10 \% (Steffen et al 1998, pp. 9).
	\item Cow slurry: (Steffen et al 1998, pp. 9) stated that Cow slurry is typically collected from feedlots by a scraper system. Straw is often added in the feedlots resulting in slight variations of total solids. Commonly little water is added for cleaning and rinsing of the cattle walkway, hence dilution with water is minimal. As for pig slurry, cow slurry also exhibits large variations in total solids contents, depending on the animal housing system. Depending on the location and operational tradition cows often spend long periods of time grazing on pastures. Reduced overall manure collection must therefore be considered in economic evaluations.
	\item Waste and wastewater from agriculture related industries: Huge amounts of agricultural raw materials are processed in the food industries. During processing, wastes and wastewater are produced. These could often be recycled as co-substrates in agricultural digesters. The resulting anaerobic sludge could then be applied as a fertilizer on agricultural land. Typical agro-industrial wastes and by-products include protein and sugar containing whey from the dairy industry or slops from fruit juice processing and alcohol distilleries. Various other crop and plant residues from industrial processing, often used or treated via other routes or landfilled, may also be treated anaerobically. Such residues can be added as co-substrates to manure or slurry digestion, provided the transport of the industrial waste can be organized on a rational basis.(Steffen et al 1998, pp. 9). 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Processes involved (Taiwo Damilola 18610)}
Biogas is defined as the mixture of gases produced by the bacterial breakdown of biomass under anaerobic conditions (Wellinger et al., 2013).The principal reaction sequences can be classified into four major stages involving the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Hydrolysis 
	\item Acidogenesis
	\item Acetogenesis/dehydrogenation
	\item Methanogenesis
	
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figb3.png}
	\caption {Basics of the Biogas Production Process:Four Stages of the Biogas Process [Stefan Junne, and Kozani, 2014 http://bit.ly/2EEThb7]	}
	\label{Basics of the Biogas Production Process:Four Stages of the Biogas Process [Stefan Junne, and Kozani, 2014 http://bit.ly/2EEThb7]	}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Hydrolysis}

In the first process called hydrolysis large organic polymers such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats are broken down or depolymerized by acidogenic bacteria into sugars, amino acids and long chain fatty acids by hydrolytic exo-enzymes excreted by fermentative microorganisms (P. Bajpai 2017). 

The hydrolysis process is very important particularly in the break-down of manure. This is because 40-50\% of the solids in manure contains complex structure known as biofibres. (Broughton 2009). Hydrolysis is a relatively slow step and it can limit the rate of the overall anaerobic digestion process, especially when using solid waste as the substrate. The products of hydrolysis that can be converted to methane are carboxylic volatiles acids, alcohols, simple sugars,H$_{2}$,CO$_{2}$ and ketones (Broughton 2009).
\\ The hydrolysis reaction is presented in the chemical equation in figure B.4.
\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption {hydrolysis in anaerobic oxidation of complex wastes [Anaerobic Technology,Pulp and Paper Industry (2017)]}
	\label{hydrolysis in anaerobic oxidation of complex wastes [Anaerobic Technology,Pulp and Paper Industry (2017)]}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Acidogenesis}
This is the breakdown of soluble organic matter produced by hydrolytic bacteria into higher organic acids such as propionic acid and butyric acid and acetic acid, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. The higher organic acids are transferred to acetic acid and hydrogen by acetogenic bacteria (Broughton 2009). According to (Guerrero et al 1999), temperature strongly affects acidification, however temperatures which results in cell death and higher energy costs such as thermophilic temperatures may result in sub-optimal temperature being preferable (Guerrero et al 1999). 
\\
The acidogenesis reaction also known as fermentative process is presented in figure B.5.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Acetogenesis/dehydrogenation}
This is the breakdown of molecules into acetic acid, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The organisms that convert intermediates such as propionate, butyrate, lactate and ethanol to acetate are obligate hydrogen producing acetogenic bacteria. These species are syntrophic in that they require the presence ‎H$_{2}$  utilising bacteria to keep hydrogen concentration below a 10$ ^{-3} $ atm (Broughton 2009).
The equation can be seen in figure B.6.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Methanogenesis}
In the final process, methane is produced by methanogenic bacteria. These bacteria are capable of metabolizing formic acid, acetic acid, methanol, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen to methane (Broughton 2009). Methanogens bacteria use the products of the previous stages to produce methane, carbon dioxide and water. those bacteria are sensitive to high and low pH (optimal range 6.5-8) and they are more active at high temperature (30-40 °C). The remain material, called digestate, cannot go under further background. The chemical reaction is to be found in figure B.7.

\subsection{Important parameters (Yi Chen 16042)}
The main factors affecting biogas production we need to consider are temperature, pH value, Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and Carbon-Nitrogen ratio (C.N). 
\subsubsection{Temperature}
Temperature selection and control are crucial to the development of the anaerobic digestion process. Temperature has a great influence on the quality and quantity of biogas production.
Metabolic activity of biogas fermentative microorganisms has a close relationship with temperature. In a certain range, the higher the temperature, the more vigorous metabolism of biogas microorganisms, the more biogas produced, the more efficient the biogas production will be. In general, in the temperature range of 8 $\sim$ 60 °C ( Budiyono, Syaichurrozi and Sumardiono, 2013) it's possible to have biogas fermentation.
However, for medium temperature fermentation, the best temperature is about 35 °C, at 40 $\sim$ 45 °C (Budiyono, Syaichurrozi and Sumardiono, 2013), the gas production will decline.
From the fermentation cycle point of view, the lower the temperature, the longer the fermentation cycle of raw materials, the higher the temperature, the shorter the fermentation cycle.
Biogas fermentation temperature suddenly increased or decreased, the gas production will have a significant impact, if the change is too large, the gas production almost stopped. For example, normally biogases digesters producing gas at 35 °C will almost stop its production if the temperature drops suddenly to 20 °C.
Therefore, Biogas production is related to temperature and the temperature is related to the season. According to the four seasons change, sunshine and temperature change. Especially into the German winter, the temperature can lower to below 5 °C. Low temperatures can reduce or stop biogas production.
Although the sunshine in winter is greatly reduced, the winter soil temperature is higher than the outdoor temperature. It is possible to to wrap the mixing tank on the insulation, and then bury it underground to provide a steady temperature but such method may not be effective. Precise control of the temperature is quite difficult and it may be easier to aid the temperature with heating.

\subsubsection{pH Value}
All life processes are carried out at a pH value determined in the anaerobic digestion process. The pH value of biogas fermentation has an important influence on gas production and quality of biogas. The optimum hydrolysis stage pH is between 5 and 6. For methane production, the optimum pH is between 6.5 and 8 (Castillo et al 2006).
In the neutral environment, it is fermented more quickly and yields more gas. The peak of gas production is very obvious, and the CH$ _{4} $ content is high.
Under alkaline conditions (initial pH value of 7.5 $ \sim $ 8.5), gas production is not large.
If the pH value drops below 6, methane production will be strongly inhibited.
Acid-producing bacteria require a pH of 5.5-7.0 during the hydrolysis stage and a pH of 6.5-8.0 for methanogenic bacteria in the final stage.

\subsubsection{ Carbon-Nitrogen ratio}
In biogas production, the C / N ratio of raw materials is essential. When the anaerobic digestion process is performed in a single stage, the optimal C / N ratio is expected to be between 15 and 25.
\begin{table}
	\caption{the C/N ratio of different organic substrates}
	\label{the C/N ratio of different organic substrates}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ | p{5cm} | c | c | c |}

\hline

\hline
Chicken waste & 45 & 3.0 & 15 \\
		
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
As table B.1 shows, the C/N ratio of various herbs, Lucerne, potato stalks, cow manure, horse dung, pig manure and chicken waste are between 15 and 25. These raw materials are more suitable for biogas fermentation.
It is also possible to mix different raw materials and so increasing biogas production.

Research shows that the use of mixed raw materials is more suitable for the production of biogas than the use of a single raw material. The increase in biogas production is particularly noticeable with sewage sludge and grasses mixed material,as shown in table B.2.
\\ In addition to the above three main factors affecting biogas production, there are other conditions need to be considered. For example, inhibitory substances for microorganisms (detergents, antibiotics etc.) which may lower the metabolism and consequently the biogas production. Furthermore, according to different anaerobic digestion environment, adding some uric acid or calcium carbonate, can speed up the reaction rate.

\subsection{Examples of biogas production plants(Wenjun Bao 16059)}
\subsubsection{Small biogas plant}
The range of small biogas plants is from  100 to 300 kW. In particular,  small biogas plants from 100 kW are perfect for family or medium sized businesses [IES MiTO - 100 - 300 kW Biogas plants].
For example FOV BIOGAS TECH focus is on the  small biogas plant business, including small canteen, small urban farmer and small rural farmer as priority customers [FOV - Biogas].

In Figure B.9 it is possible to see some informations concerning different sized plants.

	\label{Electricity  produced with FOV reactors[FOV BIOGAS TECH]}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Large biogas plant}
Large biogas plants with over 1,000 kW in power are certainly a choice of great perspective in the field of alternative energy and environmentally friendly waste treatment. Their popularity is not yet that high but they are starting to be diffused.
Large biogas plants are suitable for extremely large size situations, as large estates, cooperative associations, and consortia with public participation [IES Large biogas plants of over 1,000 kW].
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figb10.png}
	\caption {Host biogas plant [HoSt Bioenergy]}
	\label{Host biogas plant [HoSt Bioenergy]}
\end{figure}
In these industrial biogas plants, organic waste currents are digested without the addition of manure. HOST biogas plants have supplied systems for processing slaughterhouse waste, industrial and municipal primary and secondary sludge, unpacked food products, and industrial food products [HoSt Bioenergy 2018, Industrial biogas plants].

\newline
HoSt supplies biomass fired and wood boiler from 2 MWth to 50 MWth. Boilers greater than 25 MWth are built in two combustion lines in combination with one larger efficient steam turbine. This allows cost effective road transport and reducing the height of the building envelope. This modular approach also provides greater installation flexibility for our clients.

20\% to 30\% higher net electricity yield than a comparable installation based on an ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle). Achieved by a low own electricity consumption and a high boiler efficiency.

Extra high electrical efficiency during the summer due to a lower temperature of the heating water, allowing the steam in the turbine to expand further and therefore generate more electricity.[HoSt Bioenergy 2018, Biomass-fired boilers \& wood boilers].

\subsection{Digestate and its fate (Taiwo Damilola 18610)}
Digestate can be defined as a nutrient-rich material remaining after anaerobic digestion of a biodegradable feedstock. It consists of left over indigestible material and dead micro-organisms which can be used as a fertilizer for crops without any further processing, substituting industrially produced mineral fertilisers [The Official Information Portal on Anaerobic Digestion, 2018]. Digestate is normally liquid, but when originating from a dry state Anaerobic digestion process, it can also be a solid, stackable materia [Drosg et al 2015]. Makádi, Tomócsik \&  Orosz (2012) stated that digestate contains a high proportion of mineral nitrogen (N) especially in the form of ammonium which is easily available for plants.
The exact composition of digestate is determined by the plants diet and strongly depends on the nature and composition of the substrates as well as on the operational parameters of the anaerobic digestion process  [Drosg et al 2015].
\subsubsection{pH value of digestate}
The pH value of digestate can be influenced by the biochemistry of the anaerobic digestion process. Drosg et al. (2015) also stated that pH value can also be influenced by the characteristics of substrates and that the pH value of fresh digestate typically is alkaline and ranges  from 7.5 to 8.0 pH. The increased in the pH values of digestate during anaerobic digestion is as a result of the formation of ammonium carbonate $(NH _{4})_{2}CO_{3}$ and the removal of $ CO_{2} $ (Georgacakis et al 1992). On the other hand, Drosg et al. (2015) wrote that a decrease of pH is caused by the precipitation of carbonates such as calcite $ CaCO_{3} $ and of iron phosphates.
\subsubsection{Nitrogen content}
The content of ammonium in digestate is directly related to the total N content in the substrate. Pig slurry has higher N-total and $ NH_{4}-N $ contents than cattle slurry and this is directly reflected in the digestate dominated by such substrates (Drosg et al 2015). The $ NH_{4} $ content of the digestate is about 60-80\% of its total N content as reported by Makádi, Tomócsik \&  Orosz, (2012), but Furukawa and Hasegawa (2008) stated that  99\% of $ NH_{4}-N $ of the digestate is from kitchen food wastes. 

\subsubsection{Phosphorus Content}
The phosphorus content of digestate is higher in concentration than that of composts which make it more suitable for supplement of the missing macronutrients in soils [Makádi, Tomócsik \&  Orosz, 2012]. Nevertheless, co-digesting substrate with high content of phosphate substrate like pig slurries  which has high phosphate content and substrate with lower phosphate content will lower the phosphate content in the digestate produced due to simple dilution [ARBOR, 2013].
\subsubsection{Total solids content}
The content of the total organic dry matter and the carbon content of digestate are decreased by the decomposition of easily degradable carbon compounds in the digestors [Makádi, Tomócsik \& Orosz, 2012].Therefore digestate can contain 50\% to 80\% less TS compared to the incoming substrate [Drosg et al., 2015]. This implies that digestate application on soils has the potential of improving soil structure through input of inert organic matter and fibers which contributes to the formation of humus in the medium to long term.
\subsubsection{ Uses of Digestate}
Digestate is a fully fermented nutrient-rich material, which can be used as such, or can be further processed by separating it into liquid and solid fractions to be upgraded. For this reason, digestate serves as an excellent organic fertilizer that can replace inorganic fertilizers and raw manure whilst providing various benefits as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Digestate as an organic fertilizer when used for crops and as a soil improver, reduces the production of artificial fertilizers like greenhouse gas emissions in the food, feed, beverage and agricultural sectors [Susanna \& Franz, 2014].
	\item Digestate can be used to replace raw manure as fertilizer which gives plants a greater benefit.  It directly contributes to plant growth without adhering to plants or the surface of the ground. 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Pros and Cons of Digestate}
Pros:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It does not present the odor nuisance specific to raw manure, therefore providing increased land application options.
	\item It makes weed control easier and more efficient for farmers, as the process of anaerobic digestion helps to destroy unwanted weeds and viable plant propagules.
	\item It is more homogeneous, which makes the fertilizer spreading more uniform
\item Digestate brings jobs and economic advantages to regions.
	\item Digestate helps to save money by using organic fertilizers.	
\end{enumerate}

Cons:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Lack of a legal framework: Many European countries do not have appropriate (if any) legislation concerning digestate, resulting in legal barriers to the use of waste material, its conversion into products or its export abroad.  Moreover, despite the fact that AD is one of the most efficient ways of treating biowaste, in several member states it is still not recognized as a recycling process, nor is it explicitly acknowledged as recycling within the European waste hierarchy [Digestate Factsheet, 2015].
	\item Clashes with existing legislation:  The EU Nitrates Directive of 1991 is crucial for protecting Europe’s environment, however, its unclear wording has led to several misinterpretations in national legislation [Digestate Factsheet, 2015].
\item Lack of information:  Most farmers are poorly informed (or even misinformed) about the benefits of digestate and other organic fertilizers, often making them hesitant about spreading them on their land  [Digestate Factsheet, 2015].
\end{enumerate}
\section{Biogas production}
\subsection{The reactor (Yi Chen 16042)}
The biogas reactor within a biogas plant is the vessel. It can be used to produce two main products. One is digested slurry that can be used as a fertilizer, and another product is biogas that can be used as an energy source. A biogas reactor accelerates the anaerobic degradation of sludge, wastewater or biodegradable waste (e.g. animal manure, waste, vegetation etc.). It also facilitates the collection of the biogas, a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide produced in the reactor.
\subsubsection{Biogas Reactors Operation}
Biogas reactor is a steel tank appearance. Its interior has a heating tube and stirring mechanism, its blades built in the tank. Pretreated slurry into the tank from the top of the pump and the spray, the final accumulated in the bottom of the tank. It is heated while it is continuously stirred to the desired temperature. Under anaerobic conditions, the microorganisms degrade the organics and process them as shown in the diagram in figure B.11.
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{figb11.png}
	\caption {process flow diagram for a typical biogas reactor process, [Willie Scott 2010]}
	\label{process flow diagram for a typical biogas reactor process, [Willie Scott 2010]}
\end{figure}
The organics eventually go through four stages in the anaerobic reactor, producing methane. After the process is completed, the remaining sludge and carbon dioxide can be further processed, and then made into agricultural fertilizers. It can also save energy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
\subsubsection{Anaerobic digestion}
Anaerobic digestion is a process which uses a biogas reactor to degrade organic matter to produce biogas. The process of anaerobic digestion use microorganisms to break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen. The process often uses organic waste to obtain fuel.
There are four stages of anaerobic digestion which called hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis. The whole process is through anaerobic digestion reaction, making the organic matter into methane and carbon dioxide.
\subsubsection{Single-stage Anaerobic Digestion}
The common biogas plant is to take a single-stage anaerobic digestion. biogas plants are typically designed as single reactors and are used in rural households to produce biogas. Most biogas reactors are buried underground. Biogas reactors are filled with agricultural waste, animal waste and kitchen waste. Thus biogas can be obtained. The figure B.12 is a simple biogas plant.
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figb12.png}
	\caption {Small Scale Biogas Plant [blog.anaerobic-digestion.com]}
	\label{Small Scale Biogas Plant [blog.anaerobic-digestion.com]}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Two-Stage Anaerobic Digestion}
Two-stage anaerobic digestion can provide biogas plant process stability and high-quality biogas productivity. It can provide higher quality for biogas production. However, two reactors would increase the difficulty of control, and the cost is also higher than for single-stage anaerobic digesters.Therefore, two-stage anaerobic digestion is hardly designed to be used.
As shown in figure B.13, there are two reactors, one is the acidification reactor and the other is the methane reactor.The substrate is added to the first reactor and acidification occurs in the first reactor. During the first stage, hydrolysis, acidification, fermentation occurs in the first reactor.It leads to hydrogen production and acid and alcohol accumulation.During the second stage, the second reactor has methane-rich bacteria and raw biogas obtained high-quality biogas after passing through the reactor.The biogas generated in the first stage contains a high proportion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The second reactor provide higher quality biogas.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics{figb13.png}
	\caption {two stage biogas plant [https://tinyurl.com/y6vh6hax]}
	\label{two stage biogas plant [https://tinyurl.com/y6vh6hax]}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Temperature in the biogas reactor}
In anaerobic digestion, temperature has an important role. At different temperatures, the type of methanogens in the anaerobic digester will vary. There are two major methanogenic bacteria here.
One is mesophilic digestion. The primary microorganisms are mesophiles. The temperature is usually 30-38 °C or 20-45°C (Song Y.C., Kwon,S.J.and Woo,J.H. 2004).Another is thermophilic digestion. The primary microorganisms are thermophiles. The temperature is usually 49-57 °C or higher than 70°C (Song,Y.C.,Kwon,S.J.,Woo,J.H.,2004). At low temperatures, the anaerobic digestion reaction rate becomes slower. A properly temperate environment promotes faster reaction rates and thus increases methane gas production.

\subsection{Scrubbing of biogas (Yi Chen 16042)}
Biogas scrubbing is a crucial step in order to removes unwanted compounds and increases the methane content of the biogas.Biogas is a clean burning, renewable fuel containing 50-60\% methane. Besides methane, biogas contains other gases which are insignificant for practical purposes. Biogas needs to be purified by removing impurities as they come along from the digested before compress and bottler. These impurities reduce the heating efficiency of biogas. Because of H$_{2}$S and CO$_{2}$S, biogas needs to be purified in a scrubbing operation. The main purpose of scrubbing is to remove H$_{2}$SS, CO$_{2}$S and water vapour.
There are three separation units in purification scrubber: CO$_{2}$S separation unit, Moisture separation unit and H$_{2}$SS separation unit.
\subsubsection{CO2 separation unit}
The raw biogas contains carbon dioxide.Carbon dioxide can affect the efficiency of methane combustion. By removing carbon dioxide to improve biogas quality. Meanwhile, the increase of carbon dioxide gas will make the earth's surface temperature increase. Carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases. In order to protect the environment, we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Therefore, carbon dioxide separation unit is an integral part.
The raw biogas first passes through the CO2 separation unit.Calcium Oxide are used to remove carbon dioxide. Calcium Oxide reacts with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate.
\newline The chemical reaction : $ CaO + CO_{2} \rightarrow CaCO_{3} $
\newline We can also use NaOH to remove CO$_{2}$. Then pass through Ca(OH)$_{2}$ in order to check if there is any CO$_{2}$ left.
\newline The chemical reaction : $ 2NaOH+CO_{2} \rightarrow Na_{2}CO_{3}+H_{2}O $
\subsubsection{ Moisture separation unit}
Water vapor in raw biogas affects combustion efficiency. We have to remove the water vapor to get a better quality of methane.There are many ways to remove moisture, the most common way is to use desiccant.Silica gel is a granular porous silica hydrate. It is a solid, and its appearance is transparent or white. It is mainly used as a desiccant.Silica gel can be heated to remove moisture, it can be recycled. It is an economical desiccant.
In order to separate the water vapour, we set moisture separation unit. Moisture separation unit contains silica gel crystals that condense water vapour and separate moisture. The capacity of the unit is decided according to the size of the biogas plant.
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{ H2S separation unit}
Dry desulfurization is a simple, efficient, relatively low-cost desulfurization method, which is generally suitable for biogas desulfurization with a small amount of biogas and a low concentration of hydrogen sulfide. The basic principle of equipment for the dry removal of hydrogen sulfide (H$_{2}$S) from biogas gases is a method of oxidizing H$_{2}$S to sulfur or sulfur oxides by O2, also called dry oxidation. 
The natural biogas is passed through a H$_{2}$S separation unit. Hydrogen sulphide is removed by using catalyst iron oxide in the form of oxidized steel wool or iron turning from our workshop. Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ as a catalyst, it can be recycled. After chemical reaction with H$_{2}$S, fill with oxygen, we can regain Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$.
\newline The chemical reaction:
\[ 2Fe_{2}O_{3} + 6H_{2}S \rightarrow 2Fe_{2}S_{3} + 6H_{2}O  \]
\[ 2Fe_{2}S_{3} + 3O_{2} \rightarrow 2Fe_{2}O_{3} + 6S \] 
In addition to the use of iron oxide to remove hydrogen sulphide, it is also possible to use activated carbon, lye, desulfurizing tower and so on.
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{figb16.png}
	\caption {H2S separation unit  [M.K.Mohanty et al 2016]}
	\label{H2S separation unit  [M.K.Mohanty et al 2016]}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Other processes for H2S removal from natural biogas}:
\newline
When biogas is produced from anaerobic fermentation plants, especially when it is fermented at moderate or high temperatures, it carries large amounts of H$_{2}$S. Due to the presence of large amounts of water vapour in the biogas, water and H$_{2}$S in the biogas work together to accelerate the corrosion and plugging of metal pipes, valves and flow meters. In addition, SO$_{2}$ generated after the combustion of H$_{2}$S is combined with water vapour in the combustion products into sulphurous acid to cause corrosion on the metal surface of the equipment, and also causes pollution to the atmospheric environment and affects human health. Therefore, before using biogas, H$_{2}$S must be removed; wet or biological desulfurization are two other examples of how to remove such pollutant:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wet desulfurization can be grouped into a physical absorption method, chemical absorption and oxidation. Physical and chemical methods exist hydrogen sulfide reprocessing problems; the oxidation method is based on the solution as an absorbent, and oxygen carrier as a catalyst, absorbing H$_{2}$S, and its oxidation to elemental sulfur.
	Wet oxidation is the desulfurization agent dissolved in water, liquid into the equipment, mixed with biogas. Hydrogen sulfide (H$_{2}$S) in biogas undergoes oxidation reaction. Hydrogen sulfide to generate elemental sulfur absorption of liquid sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, ferrous sulfate and so on.
	Mature technology of Desulfurization efficiency can reach more than 99.5%.
	When sodium carbonate (Na$_{2}$CO$_{3}$) is used as a reagent for desulfurization, the chemical reaction:
	\[ H_{2}S + Na_{2}CO_{3} \rightarrow NaHS + NaHCO_{3}  \]
	\[ CO_{2} + Na_{2}CO_{3} + H_{2}O \rightarrow 2NaHCO_{3}  \]
	Due to the large amount of CO$_{2}$ contained in the biogas, the lye is also consumed. The system is able to control the reaction conditions (including the reaction temperature, PH value), set the optimal reaction conditions, as much as possible to reduce the lye consumption.
	\item Biological desulfurization technologies include biofiltration, biosorption and biotrickling. In the biological desulfurization process, sulfur-containing pollutants must be biodegradable to produce sulfide and then by the biological oxidation process to generate elemental sulfur to be removed. In most bioreactors, the microbial species are mainly bacteria, fungi are secondary and yeast is rare. Common bacteria are Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, Thiobacillus denitrifying and Thiobacillus thiophate.
	Taking EnvironTec's biodesulfurization technology in Austria as an example, Introducing air into biogas containing hydrogen sulfide, the hydrogen sulfide is removed by a mixed gas EnvironTec biological desulfurization tower. Special plastic packings are installed inside the reactor, which provide sufficient space for desulphurization of bacteria. The circulation of the nutrient solution keeps the filler moist and replenishes the nutrients needed for the growth of the desulfurizing bacteria. Exclusive species (such as the genus Thiobacillus or Thiobacillus),with nutrient solution in the filler breeding.
	In this case, they absorb hydrogen sulfide from the mixed biogas and convert them to elemental sulfur, which in turn is converted to dilute sulfuric acid,
	The chemical reaction: 
	\[ H_{2}S + 2O_{2} \rightarrow H_{2}SO_{4} \]
	\[ H_{2}S + O_{2} \rightarrow 2S + 2H_{2}OS + H_{2}O + 1.5O_{2}  \rightarrow H_{2}SO_{4} \]
	The resulting dilute sulfuric acid and tap water drain out of the system.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Biogas Storage (Wenjun Bao 16059)}
Most biogas is used as it is produced but often there is the need of biogas storage, either for temporary nature, at times when production exceeds consumption or during maintenance of digester equipment and the biogas production will be slowed and may not meet certain local consumption requirements [ Suscon 2018].
\newline
Biogas can be stored  in plastic bladder, drums, or commercial gas cylinders, gasbag ,water sealed gas holder ,floating cover or roof, propane or butane tanks and some of these methods  require different air pressure or space in order to store biogas.

 	\label{farm storage options for biogas[Ross et al 1996 cited in Suscon 2018]}
 \end{figure}
\subsubsection{Different Pressure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Low-Pressure biogas storage is less than 2 psi such as floating gas holders, floating gas holders 
	typically operate at pressure up to 10 inch water column, they are made of steel flexible fabric [Suscon (2018)].
	\item Biogas can also be stored at medium pressure between (2 - 200 psi),such as gas tank. In this case the biogas must first be cleaned by removing H$_{2}$S for safety reasons. Next, the cleaned biogas must be slightly compressed prior to storage in tanks. Typical propane gas tanks are rated to 250 psi. Compressing biogas to this pressure range uses about 5 kWh per 1,000 ft$^{3}$ [Ross et al 1996, pp. 5-18]. Assuming the biogas is 60\% methane and a heat rate of 13,600 Btu/kWh, the energy needed for compression is approximately 10\% of the energy content of the stored biogas [Suscon (2018)].
	\item  Biogas can be stored as CBM to save space. At high pressure gas scrubbing is very important because impurities such as H$_{2}$S and water are  likely to cause corrosion. The gas is stored in steel cylinders such as gas cylinders. The cost of compressing gas to high pressures between 2,000 and 5,000 psi is much greater than the cost of compressing gas for medium-pressure storage. Because of these high costs, the biogas is typically upgraded to biomethane, a more valuable product, prior to compression. Compression to 2,000 psi requires nearly 14 kWh per 1,000 ft$^{3}$ of biomethane [Ross et al 1996, pp. 5-19]. If the biogas is upgraded to 97\% methane and the assumed heat rate is 12,000 Btu/kWh, the energy needed for compression amounts to 17\% of the energy content of the gas[Suscon (2018)].	
\end{itemize}
A schematic approach on how to introduce compression within the biogas production can be seen in figure B.22.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Compressed and stored gas applications}
The compressed and stored biogas in cylinders can be used for various purposes. The main application of stored biogas is to generate electricity which will help in bridging the supply and demand gap. It can also replace household LPG useful for cooking purposes. CNG cylinders can be replaced by BIO CNG cylinders which will act as an environmental friendly fuel. This will help in achieving a better total net carbon emissions [IOSR Journal of Electrical and Electronics Engineering 2018].

\section{Prototype Design (Nancy Bellingan 19575)}
A general design for a homemade biogas production plant includes all the steps previously described: a reactor, a scrubbing unit, a storage system. Julen Agirre designed in Solidworks a model, which can be seen in figure B.23.
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figb22.png}
	\caption {Prototype design for biogas production [Julen Agirre]}
	\label{Prototype design for biogas production [Julen Agirre]}
\end{figure}
\newline \textbf{Biogas Tank}: the reactor in this kind of set-up is a single one in which all the four digestion processes happen in the same tank; the biomass is inserted, the barrel is closed and after it is exhausted opened again and the digestate removed, disposed, re-utilized. 
It is suggested to use a barrel with open top which is already provided with a good sealing. The size can be variable; in the design 200 L barrel was used with a facultative output and input in case of adaptation to a more classical reactor such as a continuous one with constant feeding. The material can be any hard plastic such as polyethylene. 
One sealed output is necessary for the gas being produced; a tap with a closing system and a gas-meter are suggested. The output medium can be a flexible or a rigid tube or metal rods, depending on the application and kind of environment for the prototype construction.
\newline
\textbf{Scrubbing unit}: assuming that the biogas produced isn't only intended for heating and cooking purpose, but rather for its potential as substitute of natural gas, a scrubbing system is required. As already described in the chapter about Scrubbing, it is necessary to remove hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and water; the last two, even if not dangerous, can badly affect the energy potential of the final gas.
The general idea behind this prototype model is to have a compressor at the end which is forcing at a certain pressure or flow the streaming of gas from its production to the storage system, controlling its one direction movement and making sure that before being stored the gas goes under the whole scrubbing unit, tank by tank. 
In the first small barrel, around 50 L capacity in this design, the gas reacts with Calcium Oxide and the carbon dioxide is trapped in the newly producted calcium carbonate. Other alternative for scrubbing are possible and can be easily implemented by substituting this single unit.
\newline 
For what concerns the hydrogen sulfide scrubbing, the small barrel should contain Sodium Carbonate if it's a wet desulfurization (the gas will bubble out of the water throughout the third barrel) or oxidized steel wool for a dry desulfurization.
\newline
The third barrel is for the moisture content removal: silica gel crystals are a common solution for water removal. 
\newline HDPE containers with removable top lid are a possible material; it is important there are no leakages and therefore good care should be put in the sealing and any weak point connection.
\newline.
\textbf{Compression and Storage:}
The compressor unit is necessary for the scrubbing unit and as well to redirect the gas to the appropriate storage system. It is suggested, unless strong need of having pressurized gas, to use gas bags due to the limited safety risks in the process compared to have pressurized energetic gas. 
\newline For more pictures and informations about the model, it is possible to find in the reference list the link to Google Drive folder with the Solidworks files of the 3D model 

\section{Prototype Considerations, Safety and Health (Nancy Bellingan 19575)}
When building the prototype, it is important to keep in mind the following considerations and suggestions.
\newline \textbf{Location and Security:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item it should be avoided strong changes in temperature
	\item in winter the minimum temperature should be 20°C
	\item direct exposure to sun may be problematic for the scrubbing unit and the resilience of the materials composing the system
	\item there should be a good aeration of the location
	\item only trained personnel and staff should be admitted to the biogas production plant area
	\item the chosen location should be big enough to allow the presence of storage tanks or bags in the immediate vicinity
\end{itemize}

For what concerns \textbf{Operation and Maintenance}, in order to guarantee a safe environment and a good handling of the system, the following indications should be followed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item only trained personnel should be handling and touching any biogas production plant component
	\item following the safety instructions and being aware of the risk assessment is mandatory
	\item constant maintenance of the system should be scheduled and executed by the responsible staff
	\item gas-meters for methane, CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$S levels in the air needs to be present and monitored and working 24/7
	\item emergency measures in case of leakage of gas should be developed
	\item aeration should be forced at any time for safety reasons
	\item the change of biomass in the reactor should be done only after a recovery of digestate for further utilization and a meticulous cleaning of the reactor tank
	\item an overload of the storage unit should be at any cost avoided  
\end{itemize}

The prototype here described can be strongly personalized and any construction can differ from each other due to the possibility of scrubbind units and chemical involved; the common factor to all of them are issues related to leakage of gas, in detail methane, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. 
\newline As indicated on the Toxicology Data Network [Toxnet], the three gases present possible hazards:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Methane: methane is an asphyxiant. Headache, nausea, compensatory increase of respiration
	and pulse,somnolence,dizziness, fatigue, euphoria, memory loss, decreased visual acuity, cyanosis, loss of consciousness are possible effects on humans in case of acute exposure. Methane is also easily flammable and can self-ignite above certain pressure or concentrations in storage tanks [Toxnet,  Methane].
	\item Hydrogen sulfide: is a toxic gas with potential exposure effects such as dizziness, headaches, nausea, cardiac arrhythmias, poor memory, neurobehavioral changes, pulmonary edema. It can form explosive mixtures in contact with air and can be ignited with flames, heat, sparks[Toxnet, hydrogen sulfide]. 
	\item Carbon dioxide: CO$_{2}$ is an asphyxiant with possible effects such as headache; visual disorders; unconsciousness, tachycardia. It's an inert gas [Toxnet, carbon dioxide].	 
\end{itemize}	
A first risk assessment can be read in Table B.3; it only contains the already described risks given by exposure to the hazardous gases and their explosion or ignition. As it appears clear, it is of vital importance avoid leakage and assure a god aeration and to use proper PPE, such as googles, clothin cover and more important breathing devices.

\section{Discussions and Conclusions}
\subsection{Pros Biogas production (Taiwo Damilola 18610)}
Biogas energy generation systems are in demand and their number is increasing gradually. They are low-cost and can be run with very small finances. The technology is best suited to convert the organic waste from agriculture, livestock, industries, municipalities and other human activities into energy and manure (Ali et al., 2013).
\begin{itemize}
	\item Renewable source of energy: Biogas can be used as a source to generate electricity where the wasted heat is used for other purposes. This is done by fuelling an engine-generator which in turn produces electricity. In many places, especially rural areas it is used as a medium for cooking and heating purposes.  Biogas can be used for running water pump-set and tubewell engines (Shireen Bhardwaj, and Payal 2017, pp. 892). Biogas can be compressed and used in vehicles as a source of fuel which is more efficient and less pollutant. It is a free source of renewable energy and can be used in a metal lantern as an illuminant for domestic and street lighting.
	\item  Non-polluting: 
	Biogas is clean and eco-friendly because it does not release additional carbon into the atmosphere when burnt and does not contribute to climate change. In the process of biogas production, no combustion takes place which makes it to be considered as being non-polluting in nature. The resources are conserved by not consuming any further fuel since the production of biogas does not require any oxygen. It also reduces deforestation and any sort of indoor air pollution (Shireen Bhardwaj, and Payal 2017, pp. 892)
	\item Availability and Reliability: 
	Much like with the sun and water, biogas is widely available and naturally distributed (Siegel 2012). The abundant supply simply means that biogas will not run into the same issues currently affecting fossil fuels (The Advantages and Disadvantages of Biomass Energy 2016). Biogas as a renewable sources is much more reliable compared to other energy sources like wind and solar because they rely on so many factors like, weather, day time and so on in order to produce electricity (Rinkesh 2009).
	\item Increased employment:
	In the area of waste collection and biogas generation, biogas plants have created millions of jobs in most countries. According to (Rinkesh 2009) research, the biogas industry creates more than 10 million man days jobs each year in India especially in rural areas.
	
	
	
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Cons Biogas Production (Taiwo Damilola 18610)}
Biogas even though has numerous advantages,  it is not a perfect energy source. Some of the disadvantages of biogas are closely related to the use of biogas, whereas others are due to the consequences of its production and application.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Contains impurities:	Biogas is not totally cleaned when burned. This is because burning of burning wood and other plant life creates other emissions in addition to carbon which can pollute the local environment and can corrode automobiles engines when used as fuel thereby causing high maintenance costs (Rinkesh 2009).
	\item Space: An extremely large cultivated land is needed to produce the raw materials used in biomass energy. Rural areas provide the best locations for building biogas plants because of the limited space. However, it’s impractical to built biogas plants in large cities(Evangelos 2009).
	\item  Not economically viable:	The production of biogas is not attractive economically because it is energy intensive to produce. In some cases, with little or no net gain compared to many other sources of renewable energy (Siegel 2012). According to (Rinkesh 2019), this simply why people and most governments are coy about investing in this source.
	\item Requires water to grow: One of the often and unseen disadvantages of the production is the quantity of water needed. This can lead to increased costs in terms of irrigation and may also result in water sources becoming less available to people and wildlife (The Advantages and Disadvantages of Biomass Energy 2016).
	
	
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusions (Nancy Bellingan 19575)}
The path to reduce the carbon footprint as impact of human activities is a treacherous one: It is not possible to find a single solution but rather combine different options, and one of them is Biogas. 
Biogas alone is not the solution due to a long list of disadvantages and crops shouldn't be cultivated with the only purpose of being used for biogas production, but using food waste and recycling instead of disposing is a good and sustainable approach. Realizing biogas production plants can be easy and cheap if it's not required to purify the product, while in case of need of scrubbing the gas from hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and water, the feasibility for small scale application drastically drops.
In the contest of the Green Fablab, it is suggested to implement a small if not medium size biogas production plant: food waste are constantly produced by the mensa and the students dormitories of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Science and such applications would reduce first of all the volume of waste to dispose and second it would reduce the footprint of the university and give the opportunity to develop and research in the field of the biogas, so massively expanding in developing countries and not only. A biogas plant would increase as well awareness in the staff and students of the university and of the Green Fablab and possibly positively impact their lives with a more conscious and sustainable approach.

The present concept was developed within the framework of the interdisciplinary project - IP – “FabLab Goes Green”. The ideas and concept suggestions summarized here were created by the author in collaboration with the garden and landscaping engineer Anna Bahnemann and relate to her expertise in this field. 
\section{Introduction}
As part of the module "interdisciplinary project work", the project "FabLab Goes Green" was conducted. This involved the development and implementation of an own project idea for the above topic. An important aspect was that the project should be implemented within the framework of the State Garden Show (LAGA) 2020, but that it would remain an attractive and interesting attraction for visitors and "makers" of FabLabs. With the help of an expert, a theory-based and practice-based idea concept for the design of the outdoor facilities of the Green FabLab was developed taking into account various framework conditions. This concept should serve as a source of ideas and a source of inspiration in the implementation of the grounds. In the present work, we first discuss the approach of the project work, after which various relevant terms are defined more precisely as preliminary considerations, before the theoretical background of important aspects is addressed. The following is the explanation of the "Feel Good Concepts" which represents the project result of this work. In the following conclusion, the entire project work is briefly summarized and critically reflected, as well as an outlook for possible future project work.
\section{Process plan - procedure}
In the first step, the task of the project "FabLab Goes Green" was defined and a brainstorming with mind map about possible ideas for its implementation was collected. Thereafter, the individual aspects were researched to gain an overview of possible project ideas. After reviewing the time constraints and constraints, a plan has been created, taking into account the resources available, which will provide the ideas and benefits to the project in real terms. The project goal was defined and decided to develop an idea concept in which the most important aspects for the realization of an attractive outdoor area for the Green FabLab are considered. In order to include the expertise in the field of gardening and landscaping, it was decided to work together with the garden and landscaping engineer Anna Bahnemann. Subsequently, milestones were defined for the individual project phases. Furthermore, considerations were made as to what potential project risks could be. This was followed by the preparation of the timeline for the implementation of these milestones, which was used for its review and coordination with the external expert. Then it went to the implementation of the process plan. For more information see the Handbook.
\section{Definitions}
\subsection{The idea of Green FabLab with the participatory approach}
The idea of the Green FabLab is to create a place in which people exchange their knowledge with each other, learn new things and through research, discovery and own testing form an innovative knowledge. One of the most important aspects of Green FabLab is the participatory approach. This means that the development of knowledge in the area of interest for the "Maker" (people who work on projects in FabLab) takes place through the exchange of experience and knowledge as well as self-experiences with the peer group or experts. Knowledge solidifies and is understood through experimentation and personal experience (Beyers R. N. 2010). Benjamin Franklin's quote describes very well the usefulness of this participatory approach, which prevails in FabLab as a basic idea: \\

	"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn."
\end{center} \\
\begin{flushright}
	(Benjamin Franklin w. year)

The Green FabLab is a research center that deals with the idea of self-sufficiency and worldwide networking. It offers the opportunity to learn directly from nature and to use this understanding for the regeneration of 21st century cities (Green FabLab Barcelona 2018).
\subsection{The task of the IP "FabLab Goes Green"}
The task was to develop an idea which can be implemented under the interdisciplinary project "FabLab Goes Green" as a project of the University of Applied Sciences Rhine-Waal within the scope of the LAGA 2020 in Kamp-Lintfort. The task was kept very open and allowed thereby a lot of creative freedom for individual ideas. Certain framework conditions were mentioned, which should be considered during the implementation and are explained in more detail in the following section.
\subsection{General conditions, conditions and problem definition}
As framework conditions, the important values and aspects of the Green FabLab (such as ecological, sustainability, togetherness, etc.) should be considered in the implementation. Furthermore, there were certain circumstances of the available area which at the same time presented a challenge. The area on which the Green FabLab and its outdoor area is to be built is located on the old colliery of Kamp-Lintfort. Since the colliery area is to be completely redesigned as part of the “Landesgartenschau” 2020, a largely cleared fallow area will be available after completion of the Green FabLab building. Due to the years of mining use of the terrain, the soil quality is relatively poor. The soil must be removed during the dismantling phase a piece. For the future re-greening of the area, the quality of the soil as well as a possible soil preparation must be considered (Figure 15-17). Furthermore, a water catch basin is planned on the area that will be provided for the project, which will limit the actual size of this area (Figure C.42). This basin, most of the time will not lead to water, but should be considered as design elements of the area taken into account so as not to stand out negative from the overall concept. In addition, it blocks access to the grove on the other side of the creek (Figure C.35). The area to be designed should be multifunctional usable and remain, as the project "FabLab Goes Green" for the time being has a time-limited right of use. The project, which is planned as a project contribution of the University of Applied Sciences for the State Garden Show 2020, should, however, prove to be more desirable and establish itself as an integral part of the university on the site. In the future, the Green FabLab should be able to independently finance itself through its high attractiveness and a variety of offer options.
\\ \\
\textbf{The Third Mission} \\
„Im Zuge der sich wandelnden Gesellschaft, die auch und insbesondere durch demografischen Wandel geprägt wird, ändern sich auch die Aufgaben von und die Ansprüche an Hochschulen. Hochschulen nehmen zunehmend weitere gesellschaftlich relevante Funktionen jenseits „klassischer“ Forschung und Lehre wahr, die mit dem Begriff „Third Mission“ beschrieben werden.“  \\

\end{flushright}
In summary, projects fulfilling the requirements of having added value for society are funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The external performance evaluation in this regard is carried out by the Institute for Research on Higher Education (HOF), which helps higher education institutions to "make their commitment" visible with regard to the Third Mission (HOF 2013-2016). If the planning and the concept of the university for the Green FabLab meet these requirements, the implementation can be supported by state funds. Such a support program is, for example, Horizon 2020, whose goal is "quick and easy to promote application-oriented, very innovative industrial projects" (EU Bureau of the BMBF 2018). According to Dr. Moritz Warnecke (2017) are aspects to be considered in all parts of Horizon 2020: the use of safe, clean and efficient energy, climate protection, environment and resource efficiency, as well as areas of society such as integration and equality (Warnecke M. 2017).
\subsection{Target group}
In order to adapt the approach to the visitors as well as the attractiveness of the site to the expectations and wishes of the target group, it is important to define them in advance as precisely as possible. First of all, however, it must be noted that not only the topic of the Green FabLab is important for the definition of the target group, but also the framework in which the project is to be implemented, namely the State Garden Show 2020. As an additional factor, the place where the Event should be considered, namely the city Kamp-Lintfort. The “Landesgartenschau” 2020 is visited not only by adults, but also by many families with children. As the motto of the State Garden Show in Kamp-Lintfort is "Monastery, Coal, Campus" and there is a great connection to the university, many students will also participate in the event. The relationship to the city and its historical background to the coal mine plays a role for history enthusiasts as well as for future-oriented persons. Also, companies in the area should become aware of the project and its possibilities and recognize the resistance in it. In order to clarify the added value for the general public and the openness of the Green FabLab for everyone, cooperation can be formed with other municipal institutions such as kindergartens, schools or old people's homes. The target group determination is difficult in this respect, because a really broad mass with different interests should be addressed. An exact sociodemographic classification is therefore not possible. In order to simplify the topic, the commonalities of the different sub-target groups were identified.\\
\textbf{Interests:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item enjoyment of nature, people, technology and culture
	\item Reference to the city of Kamp-Lintfort, the old mine and or the future-oriented University of Rhine-Waal
	\item entertainment, curiosity, participation, discovery
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Expectations:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Quality, safety, practicality, sympathetic appearance, honest dialogue, good value for money, family orientation, integration, reliability, play, fun, entertainment, spending time together and relaxation.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Speech:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Internet:
	Set up your own internal page for the “Landesgartenschau” 2020 and link it to the homepage of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences and the page of Kamp-Lintfort
	\item Social media:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item to special attractions. A connection to the calendar of events would be advantageous.
		\item Create a profile on Facebook and Twitter and share the latest news on these media
		\item Radio advertising in local broadcasting (for example: Radio KW, WDR 2 and “Antenne Niederrhein”)
		\item TV - Report in the "Lokahlzeit - Duisburg"
		\item Newspaper - press section in the local newspapers
	\end{itemize}
	\item locally:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Flyers and posters in the surrounding shops and restaurants
			\item Attractive leisure activities (climbing wall, playground, connection to the “Wandelweg”, Green FabLab)
			\item “Kaligator” – the mascot of the university and the city of Kamp-Lintfort in the form of a crocodile (has already been tested as part of the introductory week 2017 at the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences) can serve as an animation character primarily for children and introduce them playfully to nature and the Green FabLab
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Aim of this paper}
The aim of this paper is to bring together a variety of ideas and relevant aspects around the topic of the Green FabLab and to develop them in an overall concept. The focus was placed on the attractiveness and the feel-good atmosphere of the outdoor area. It should create a pool of ideas that can be used as inspiration for the planning and implementation of the Green FabLab. The "Feel Good Concept" aims to create a “feel-good location” that will be as interesting and attractive as possible to many visitors in order to create a great attraction for the Green FabLab. Due to the attractive appearance of the garden grounds, the Green FabLab should be positively established on the site and gladly visited. The "Feel Good Concept" for the garden area is intended to reflect the idea of the FabLab. It aims to create a place of encounter, creativity, exchange and learning. The aim is to make the visitors feel comfortable and given a space by giving them the opportunity to pursue their individual needs, to innovate, to try, to experience, to exchange ideas, to relax, or to be inspired to enjoy common get-togethers. By including other influencing factors that influence the attractiveness and the feel-good atmosphere, important connections will also be considered in the future. The developed concept can be used to realize ideas from the collected fundus or to pick up on sub-aspects. The concept is to combine the idea of the Green FabLab with its values and ideas, as well as the idea of community and cooperation in outdoor design. A sub-goal of the present work is to incorporate the respective project work of other groups of the IP "FabLab Goes Green" and to provide them with a suitable space on the garden grounds. It was limited to the outside area of the Green FabLab, as it offers a relatively large space for the implementation of various possibilities. Furthermore, there is the essential aspect of the "FabLab Goes Green" (namely, the "Green") given by the garden area, which should also show in the design to the outside for the visitors. A careless-looking "little piece of garden" would be quite disappointing in the course of the “Landesgartenschau” 2020. Therefore, the optimal radiance of the terrain is a significant factor. With the "Feel Good Concept", the garden complex should become a crowd puller for visitors to the LAGA 2020, while at the same time meeting the requirements and expectations of the various target groups.
\section{Theoretical background}
In order to bring the practice-related “know-how” of the expert to an empirically proven basis, the following section deals in detail with various theoretical backgrounds on relevant aspects of the "Feel Good Concept" of the garden layout of the Green FabLab. 
\subsection{The "special"}
When people find a place to be particularly attractive and attractive, it often creates for them a form of experience that awakens a certain positive tension, curiosity and expectations. If these expectations are fulfilled or positively changed they are surprising. A kind of "magic" spreads the feeling that most people would call "something special".
Places that spread a feel-good atmosphere usually follow a certain order and clarity in the design. As a result, they are soothing and in harmony with their environment and the individual elements contained therein. The feeling of wellbeing can be described as: "It feels right and good, as if you could not be better anywhere than there." Humans will experience this place as something special, perhaps as a balance to something and will do it more often want to visit him to relive him.
Feelings about something are difficult to describe, moreover, feelings are very individual just as each person is different. The question that arises is: "How do you create a place that looks as attractive as possible to a large number of people?" Presumably, it is too much to ask for something that everyone really likes and appeals to everyone. Therefore, the most important common interests were identified from the most important target groups, which were taken up in the present concept.
\subsection{Perception - conditions of aesthetic perception}
The subjective perception of areas is the subject of perceptual and environmental psychology. The key message is (Tessin 2008) „... Räume werden unterschiedlich wahrgenommen sowohl in Richtung auf das, was man sieht, als auch in Richtung, wie das Wahrgenommene auf einen wirkt und wie man es bewertet.“ (Tessin 2008). The perception of people is very great individual (Tessin 2008). According to him, three aspects of perception can be called significant. On the one hand, a person only perceives what he is physiologically capable of (sounds that are too quiet for the ears cannot be perceived). Next, the emotional level can be called. It decides how the human being perceives the perceived, with which feeling he connects the perceived (positive or negative). The third aspect is the evaluative level of relevance. Here it is decided how a person evaluates what he has taken, whether it has meaning for him or not (Tessin 2008). At all levels personality, individual previous experience and the directed attention of the person have an influencing effect.
\subsection{Factors influencing the attractiveness and the “feel-good atmosphere”}
In his book on the "Aesthetics of Pleasant Things", Tessin (2008) writes that various aspects of the feel-good factor in open space design are decisive. The following important aspects for a pleasant effect of static free spaces are mentioned. On the one hand, it addresses accessibility, security with order and condition, the equipment of open spaces, function and use under the point of use, on the other hand nature as aspect, the feeling of escape from everyday life, and design in the artistic sense , In the following, the individual aspects are only briefly summarized. 
\subsubsection{Summary – „Feel-good area“}
In summary, a place of “well-being” can be described as a spatial situation in which a person is freed from his everyday life and can recover by social relief, nature and freedom. This aspect is described by Tessin (2008 p. 36 quoted in Kaplan p. 1995) as "being away" and the recovery effect as "restoration" (Tessin 2008). Kaplan S. (1995) describes that a place of wellbeing does not require concentrated but rather incidental attention. This is achieved through clarity, order, familiarity, security, consistency and coherence. In order not to get bored in a rather low-stimulus environment, the place should have enough stimulation. These suggestions are described by Kaplan as "fascination" (the special). For example, "Fascination" can be offered through variety, variety and events. With fascination "harmless things are meant, like a cloud or a stream. The “compatibility” thus the fit of the place to the individual desires and needs of the person supports, according to Kaplan, the utility, self-determination, peace and rest of the persons. These so-called "reactive activities" should be allowed and supported by the realities of the open space.
\subsubsection{The "special"}
As mentioned in Maslow's Need Pyramid of 1954, the lowest needs are at the physiological level. These can be, for example, the "fresh air" satisfaction, the sight of greenery or a bit of movement. This satisfaction of basic needs is important and enjoyable according to Maslow, but does not trigger any enthusiasm for the visitor. In order to experience enthusiasm for an open space, the next levels of the need pyramid should be included in the satisfaction of the basic needs. As an example, Tessin mentions an exceptionally "beautiful" design of the open space (Tessin 2008 p. 54). However, this raises the question of what exactly constitutes a "beautiful" design? According to Tessin (2008 p. 54), women attach much more importance to the aspect of design than men, and they also enjoy much more "alone at the sight of a green space". It is mentioned that especially younger men under the age of 30 attribute the aspect of design to a much lower importance (Tessin 2008). Tessin (2008 p. 56) explains that the design of open spaces depends on the visitor's expectations of the aesthetics. According to him, two types of claims can be distinguished. On the one hand the “everyday aesthetics” and on the other the “excursion” or “sightseeing aesthetics”. In everyday aesthetics, the level of claim is rather on a low level and usually meets even the lowest demands. Here it is sufficient to design the space in the direction of "pretty", complacent and familiar. When it comes to the aesthetics of excursions or sightseeing, one assumes a much higher aesthetic standard for the open space. Here, the design must go far beyond the pretty, pleasing and familiar. In summary, the people whose goal is to take a trip and want to visit something, want to get something offered. Thus, then the claim to the aesthetics of the design is much higher. In everyday life, however, the space must be just pretty and pleasing. According to Tessin 2008 p. 56), this division of aesthetic demands applies to all age groups and aesthetic milieus. Tessin (2008 p. 58) was able to show that the visiting visitors also have a higher demand for stimulation, variety, new impressions and interesting things or something special concerning the open space. Everyday visitors were largely undemanding in these aspects. These findings were also independent of age, gender and cultural milieu. It is considered beautiful what pleases and not whether it has a high artistic or aesthetic value.
\subsection{Learning}
A common definition of learning describes this „... als einen Prozess, der als Ergebnis von Erfahrungen relativ langfristige Änderungen im Verhaltenspotential erzeugt“ (Anderson J.R. 2000). In summary, one can say that learning is a process, the result of which is behavioral change. The learning itself cannot be observed. Therefore, the long-term change in behavior is seen as an indicator of the learning that has taken place (Kiesel A., Koch I. 2012). There are several theories about how people learn, in this context are just a few examples. Learning through punishment or reward was called operant conditioning by Skinner (1938). Here the learning experience follows from a consequence (Skinner B.F. 1938). Bandura (1965) found that humans and animals do not only learn when they act or respond to stimuli (Bandura A. 1965). The so-called learning on the model (observation learning) causes an enormous increase in learning. People are able to adapt their behavior without having to make mistakes themselves, or have to try for a long time, which behavior will be successful in a situation (Kiesel and Koch 2012).
The study by (Beyers R. N. 2010) was able to show that the skills in creativity and innovation in children were increased by working in FabLab. The increase in learning through personal experience was enormous (Beyers R. N. 2010). This makes it clear that the already mentioned quote from Benjamin Franklin in terms of learning and research in FabLab fits particularly well. People who can build up knowledge through their own experience understand and retain it better and can transfer and apply it accordingly.
\subsection{Importance of university research for the industry}
Since the economy, and thus also research and development, in the Federal Republic of Germany is predominantly free-market organized, the industry bears the responsibility for technical innovation (Grüneberg O.H 1990). According to Grüneberg 1990, the world electronic market is growing very fast due to information technology today and the innovation cycles are getting shorter and shorter. The expenditure on research and development is increasing. The resources needed must therefore be used effectively, especially the academic potential of the universities. Close cooperation between industry and science creates the prerequisites for new technical innovations and future-oriented competitiveness through the increased exchange of young scientists (Grüneberg 1990).
\section{Idea concept - "Feel Good Concept"}
After various meetings with the gardening and landscaping engineer Anna Bahnemann, the decision was made to divide the area into various subject areas (Figure C.30). The reason for this lies in the different usage of the areas and in the large number of visitors who are supposed to enter the area and use it at the same time. The following areas were considered important and further developed by taking into account the requirements of the terrain.
\subsection{Space For community and togetherness}
First and foremost, the idea behind the Green FabLab is to combine collaborative research and teaching through knowledge exchange in harmony with nature. An important aspect is therefore also to provide a space for communal living in the form of open spaces such as meadows, a courtyard, or sufficient seating for teaching outdoors (Figure C19-23). The possibility for leisure activities such as joint barbecues should be given. Through the open system, visitors should be able to use the grounds for their own purposes at any time. The terrain is designed to be inviting, positive and soothing to lighten and relax the atmosphere of many people's adventures. This can be achieved by a certain order and subdivision of the areas in subject areas. Here, certain areas of the site are assigned to their optimal use (Figure C.1). Another important aspect is that the work and research areas provide enough space for groups. An exchange is only possible if several people also have the opportunity to work together, to discover together and to research together (Figure C.12-13).
\subsection{Space for Teaching Research and Support}
One of the most important aspects of Green FabLab is learning. Through the knowledge of experts and the exchange with the peer group, visitors to the Green FabLab are to be supported in developing and developing specific knowledge in areas that are of interest to them. Due to the good equipment and diversity of the Green FabLab, which should also be reflected in the outdoor area (Figure C.26-28), it is possible to get to know and to try out machines and techniques as well as materials that "normally" are not Would get contact. By changing course offers topics, such as the "construction of your own wind turbine" or similar can be done on the site. For these courses, internal or external experts in this field may be invited to share their expertise with the course participants. Experts can also be the "makers" themselves. By offering their own technical advances to others, these individuals not only expand their personal skills, but also role models and models for others.
Here are some examples from the different subject areas (mathematics, art, technology, science, etc.), which invite you to research, discover and try out. The large meadow area can serve as an airfield for drones or as a racetrack for self-built electric vehicles (Figure C.14). A water treatment plant with microorganisms, animals and plants that naturally improve water quality can be built (Figure C.18). On the grounds of the Green FabLab, areas will be set up that will allow teaching in the lecture hall or classroom to be relocated outdoors. In appropriate weather, on the one hand, the learning atmosphere can be made more pleasant and more interesting, on the other hand, such rather rare excursions and the associated teaching content are much easier to remember, as many more sensory impressions are stored. Cooperations with child daycare centers, refugee homes or other social facilities (nursing home, holiday care, homeless shelters, chalkboard, etc.) can create projects such as the "Kinderuni" or "Kaffeetreff", which promote cooperation, integration and equal opportunities.
\begin{itemize}
	\item "Kinderuni" (Children's University) - a project through which even the "smallest" can be introduced early to education and research and discover the fun of learning. Children from families with a rather weak educational background can thus gain access to higher education or facilitate contact.
\item "Kaffeetreff" (Coffee meeting) - a community-promoting project for the general population, where it is possible to meet for coffee and cake in the FabLab and, incidentally, to repair defective everyday objects (Figure C.36).
\end{itemize}
Events such as "Girl's Day" are designed to help girls gain access to technical labs such as the Green FabLab and reduce prejudices about gender-specific role allocation in the engineering and industrial sectors. The shared use of the site by various interest groups would be at the forefront of such projects. This mix of different target groups creates a place of encounter and diversity of competence. Prejudices and stereotypes can be reduced by equal opportunities and equal rights.
\subsection{Space for fun, games and relaxation}
The planned site for the Green FabLab is centrally located and easy to reach for the many surrounding target groups. Like a little oasis of the senses, it is not only intended to create space for productive work and research, but also, for example, a place of well-being and leisure activities. For example, the terrain can be used to fly a drone during lunch, relax in the grass, or play chess with friends (Figure C.24-25). Different target groups should be able to exercise their individual needs of play, fun and relaxation through various leisure activities. It is important that the site offers interesting objects or situations that "delight". A water feature, for example, which invites children to play is an interesting eye-catcher in the entrance area of the Green FabLab (Figure C.4-5). The changing shapes of the water and the pleasant background noise provide a contrast to the gray city noise and everyday life. The outdoor area should not be blocked by a gate or a fence for visitors. The access should be possible at any time. However, the entrance area to the outdoor area is designed to be angled so that the actual garden is difficult to see (Figure C.2). As a result, it remains open at all times, but it creates a secluded space with the effect of an oasis that allows an escape from everyday life (Figure C.3-29). The street noise and exhaust emissions of the city are shielded by this and also parents have the possibility to let their children in a safe area "free running" without having to worry. While the little ones playfully engage, the parents can take a closer look at the conditions and the FabLab and enjoy the area with its visitors (Figure C.37). \\
\textbf{Ideas on the question: what excites people?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Natural installations that inspire and inspire - always changing (through movement)
	\item Connecting art, culture, nature and technology. Through knowledge and a different point of view, incorporate fascinating elements that are inspiring
	\item incorporate the elements of nature (water, earth, air, fire) into the design
	\item Hidden details that can be discovered
	\item Clear structures, order, overview (calming, relaxing and correct)
	\item Working with noises (walking over gravel, splashing water, sound play) (Figure C.40-41).
	\item Cooperations with all faculties of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences form part of projects that allow to use and co-design the area of the Green FabLab for research purposes and leisure activities. They contribute to the growth and development of FabLabs.
\end{itemize}
Work carried out to benefit the Green FabLab after completion of the projects, can be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item construction of a well (for irrigating the garden)
	\item Installing a rainwater catch basin to water the green building facade (Figure C.6-11).
	\item Art and cultural exhibitions (installations, sculptures, pictures, photos) from the individual faculties of the university or other public institutions to natural topics (combining nature and culture) (Figure C.31).
	\item Make the garden grounds an ecosystem that allows a variety of forms of life (animals, people, plants, technology).
	\item Wind turbine for power generation (with regard to financial independence and resource-conserving energy production)
	\item A garden of experiencing, discovering, researching, teaching and for leisure
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Space for Creativity, Personal Development and Innovation }
In order to create a space for creativity and innovative ideas, visitors must be able to develop freely. It is important to create a variety of possibilities that allow a valuation-free flow of thought. It can be helpful to discover things at random or in the game or to perceive things differently. A change of perspectives that allows us to take a different perspective can produce a tremendous impact here (Figure C.38-39). An open attitude towards intuitive thoughts can help to question and rethink basic assumptions and cognitive rules.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Through paths other than "normal", such as making a sudden bend or changing levels.
	\item Through an observation deck or paths that lead underground like a ditch (change from bird's eye view to frog's eye view). Fragrant shrubs that are then at "nose height" are perceived differently and completely new sensory impressions can arise (discovering angles that otherwise remain hidden).
	\item Moving objects, such as a fountain or “spiraling Things” which are moving by the wind, can create inspirational patterns and color changes (Figure C.4).
	\item Through creative "new" use of everyday objects (questioning habits and cognitive usage restrictions). For example, a trickle of watering cans or art from old stained glass bottles (Figure C.32-34).
	\item Sounds and sounds created by the power of the wind, water or technique (music machine, sound play) (Figures C.40-41).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The special work out - Attractiveness for the masses}
For a good appearance of the Green FabLab, which has a long lasting positive effect on visitors, it is important that there is a unique selling proposition. The unique selling point has to be something "special", something you can only experience when visiting the Green FabLab. On the one hand, the principle of learning through intrinsic motivation and knowledge transfer can be mentioned. There should be a positive combination of learning and discovery through self-awareness that allows visitors to choose their own areas of interest and to do research in them. The Green FabLab area has to offer various possibilities of unfolding and testing for the most diverse subject areas. For this it needs a good equipment and easily accessible as well as easy to understand instructions of the areas and the associated devices. One way would be to visualize instructions by explaining signs on each topic. This would have to be implemented in German and English. It would also be possible to use an app that guides the visitor via smartphone through the various areas of the Green FabLab site and offers suggestions for activities or explains connections and processes.
Special environments such as the Green FabLab require, among other things, a special "corporate culture". In addition to a strong relation to equality of opportunity, the Maker mentality, the knowledge exchange and innovative learning and research, sufficient freedom and openness for any form of ideas, "different thinking" or "being different" must be offered.
\subsection{Space for projects and cooperation}
Since the implementation of large or technically very complex projects usually causes quite high costs, cooperations with companies that benefit from the innovative research of the Green FabLab (especially on the ecological and sustainable level) would be a win-win situation for both sides. Companies would benefit from the innovative and open-minded appetite for research as well as possibly the "makers" approach and may find future employees in them. The FabLab community would continue to receive funding for education and research through funding. For example, the site could serve as a "testing ground" for irrigation systems in Agra research or for technical innovation.
Since the implementation of many project ideas or only partial areas involves high costs, it is advantageous to create a demand and cost plan for the individual sub-elements of the overall concept. The maintenance costs should also be included. By listing all the costs, it is easier for sponsors to finance elements and thus gradually realize the overall concept in small steps. Through targeted actions that already take place in the FabLab, such as 3D printer construction in cooperation with school classes, the independent financing of the FabLab can be supported. By an appropriate outdoor area, the offer can be extended even more space is available.
Cooperations with the different fields of study of the University of Applied Sciences Rhine-Waal would bring a dynamic into the future development of the Green FabLab. Together, the benefits for the general public and its added value can grow through the implementation of various project ideas. Through their own projects implemented on the site creates a commitment to the people involved in relation to the Green FabLab which can contribute to a faster establishment of this site. In the appendix (see sketch plan 1 Figure C.42) the first project ideas, which were created among other things during the cooperation in the interdisciplinary project "FabLab Goes Green", are taken up and included in the area planning. A short questionnaire was developed to cover the most important usage and general conditions of the projects as well as possible dangers. The gained aspects were taken into account in the area planning. The individual projects are indicated in the sketch plan under the corresponding letters.
\subsection{Further factors influencing the attractiveness and the feel-good atmosphere}
\textbf{The role of the staff and the "corporate culture"} \\
It is important that the employee working there actually live a “corporate culture” that would be appreciated by a broad mass as pleasant and suitable. This includes dealing with each other's friendly and helpful / supportive nature should be. The staff not only has to be trained in handling all Green FabLab machines and programs, but also has enough time and peace to teach the techniques and skills. A strict distribution of tasks, a clear structure and hierarchies should clearly define the roles and responsibilities. The staff members of the Green FabLab are supposed to be the contact persons for the "Makers" (people who act in the FabLab), but they only support the project for the respective person. Employees should be able to delegate and hand over the tasks involved. For this, it is important to build up a pool of people who would like to volunteer, for example as volunteers, in the FabLab. It is not the goal that the FabLab employees "handle" the concerns of the interested people. They should only help and point out to whom they can turn for specific questions. The goal is to learn the "Maker" from each other and support each other in problems, so it comes to knowledge transfer and the combination of different areas of application. This exchange of knowledge should lead to new inventions and innovations. The aim should therefore be that the employees of the FabLab create a framework in which all machines and tools, as well as aids and programs can be found and operated as simply and as self-explanatory as possible. It would be advantageous, for example, to carry out courses for the operation of certain devices at regular intervals of the year, which helps to spread, to refresh and thus to simplify the knowledge and know-how about the work with the equipment. Here, color and control systems in the premises of the Green FabLab can have a supporting effect, which identifies workplaces and ensures that they are intuitive to use and understandable by anyone.
\subsection{Possible financing}
First of all, the "FabLab Goes Green" project has to be set up through subsidies. For this it is important that the framework conditions for fulfilling the "Third Mission" are met. It is also important that financial means for the promotion and development of innovations contribute through cooperation or sponsorship of companies in the area. The benefit to the companies from the project may be advertising, employee recruiting or innovation research. In the future it should be achieved that the project "Green FabLab" can finance itself by a sophisticated marketing strategy. But there must be an interesting, attractive offer for the public. On the grounds of the Green FabLab, for example, theater performances can be held, or temporary exhibitions of artists can find their place. There are various courses available in and around the Green FabLab (how do I build my own "water treatment plant"?). Ecological and sustainable energy use and recovery can help keep maintenance costs as low as possible. Due to the high ecological awareness of the users of the Green FabLab, as well as a "resource-saving" corporate culture, the financing can be positively influenced.
\section{Summary - Criticism - Conclusion - Outlook}
At the time of brainstorming and planning the concept, specific information was not yet available. Also, no concrete information on prices or costs could be made. It lacked the necessary know-how to implement the ideas in the self-made drawings Scale true, so they cannot be used as a 1 to 1 template. The measurements proposed here are based on pure speculation and are based on the proportions of the architect's drawings. For true to scale and exact construction planning experts must be consulted and the missing information (such as power supply, water supply and water disposal, etc.) are obtained. As a result, no exact planning was carried out, but "only" developed an idea concept. In summary, it can be said that by working on the "Feel Good Concept" for the Green FabLab, a comprehensive collection of ideas has been put together, which can be used for the following construction and design measures of the outdoor area to realize the many possible individual projects. The most important theoretical background was incorporated and considered, so that the concept was built on a good foundation together with the practical relevance of the expertise. In many ways, the influencing factors and possibilities were incorporated into the "Feel Good Concept". Furthermore, the concept makes it possible to adapt the implementation to current needs and available financial resources. A cooperation with the different fields of study of the University of Applied Sciences Rhine-Waal, municipal institutions and companies of the environment and their influence on the dynamics of this project is desired and given. Furthermore, as already mentioned in the text, the "overall package" of the "Feel Good Concept" is not just about the design of the outdoor area. The "corporate culture" of the Green FabLab as well as its spatial equipment, division and division and the attitude of the employees are included as further aspects. Developing and living a company culture as well as developing a control system are therefore of the highest priority in the future as these are fundamental for the further development of the project and should in any case become the following projects. In order to be able to evaluate the attractiveness of the outdoor area as well as the effect of the "Feel Good Concepts" in retrospect, data must be collected. It is possible to develop a questionnaire which the visitors can either fill online or manually on site. The questionnaire should address various areas and topics of the site as well as specific information provided by the person interviewed. Here, not only socio-demographic data (age, gender, etc.) of the respondent, but also specific information on the outdoor area (structure, design, attractiveness, fun factor, variety of offers, clarity) can be recorded. Furthermore, it should provide a field for feedback and free comments as well as ideas and suggestions from the visitors. Not only can the collected data capture the successful execution of the project, but it is also possible to further develop the project for and with the visitor.
By working on the project, new professional perspectives and opportunities opened up that will be taken up in the future. If the concept were well received and implemented, it would be very desirable. The author would like to continue to be available for this purpose. The increase in learning in this specific topic was very high through the exchange with the expert Anna Bahnemann and the ability to communicate in English as well as the experience of teamwork in intercultural groups could be expanded.

Example of a subdivision of the terrain into subareas: By dividing the entire site into subareas, specific topics are created that can be used differently without interfering with other areas. It can be created so many different conditions of use that can exist side by side and at the same time make the terrain more exciting and interesting. There is something new to discover behind every corner. Invisible areas create tension and curiosity.

Example of the water feature in the entrance area: 
The element of water, which can be shaped and changed in many ways, would give an attractive, changing and creative kind of attraction. Children like to play in the cool waters on hot summer days and adults watch the changing shapes with interest. Teenagers are having fun meeting the unexpectedly appearing fountains. The rippling noise of the water helps to make the outdoor area also acoustically appealing, away from the street noise of the city.

With such an arrangement of shape and height difference which ends in a seat connected with the wall, an ideal collection and meeting point in the courtyard area in front of the Green FabLab would have been created. The design could be visually highlighted by the "snail" would be applied in the appropriate size, so that in the middle of a tree (for example, a red maple) could be planted. This interesting and eye-catching eye-catcher offers protection from the sun and also from rain.

Example of innovative greening:
At the same time, the plants that rise high on the façade simultaneously function as shade dispensers and room dividers. In the entrance area, the roof can be extended by this form of greening and creates a pleasant atmosphere. For the Green FabLab, the lowest point should be one height, so there are no unusable or hard-to-clean corners. The green canopy creates a special effect and contributes significantly to an interesting and pleasant-looking garden design in the entrance area of the building. Thematically it brings the green from outside also optically into the interior, since it can also be viewed from inside and the shadows fall into it.

\\ Figure C.9 Source : https://favim.com/image/3811656/ \\ Example of Room Dividing Elements: 
The idea with the Recycled PET bottles can also be taken up as a room divider. The fact that the terrain is quite large and should be used by many people at the same time, an optical subdivision of the areas makes sense. By separating sidewalks can be given or "high, deep" designs loosen up the surface and make it more interesting.

Example of a shady creative greening of the outer facade:
By plants attached to the outer facade and there “high-ranking” plants, not only the reference to the "green" of the Green FabLab can be produced optically. The building, with its hot-dip galvanized façade, could easily be too cold and spray the charm of a container. Through plants that lay like a curtain over the roof of the building creates a light and shadow play when the wind passes through. The natural movement is soothing and inspiring. The curtain could look like a kind of gate through which you enter the building.

Example of teaching outdoors:
The attached table and designated outdoor seating area can be used to teach lessons, weather permitting. This is useful in connection with projects that are carried out on the outdoor area and provide a brief instruction or later reflection beforehand. In this way, experience and teaching can be brought together close to the situation, which promises a higher understanding and a faster understanding of the topic.

Example of a raised bed:
As a result, as mentioned in the problem, the soil quality of the terrain is relatively poor, it is recommended to grow the crops to be grown in so-called "raised beds". On the one hand, the processing and observation of the area is easier, because they have a back-friendly working height. On the other hand, they are better protected from predators such as rabbits.

Example of the design of a water treatment plant or a water biotope:
Through the pond-like border, the biotope can be better observed and researched in the first place, because it is a little higher and so the viewing is more pleasant. It is possible to sit down while watching. Furthermore, it is a "beautiful place" where you can hear rippling water, likes to linger to possibly observe animals in the water. In addition, the safety for infants is considered because they cannot fall into the pelvis so quickly. The height of the pool serves as a hurdle and as protection against drowning.

In order to distribute sufficient seating over the entire area and thus also to create an opportunity for meeting rooms of several people offer half-round seating on the possibly also in the height ascending staggered positioned behind each other so that a kind of grandstand arises. This would be modeled on the lecture hall and would provide enough space for outdoor events.

Example of floor design with different materials: 
Thus, the attempt is to be made with minimal means an optically optimal solution for the design of the outdoor area. Is the thought close to the collected remainders which may be donated are used. This results in a mix of materials that would be very beneficial to the idea of diversity and integration. An optically diverse designed area with different materials is more interesting. It is an experience to run on different materials and requires all the senses. The path has a decelerating effect, as the various materials have to be addressed while walking. The large stone slabs and their arrangement also allow wheelchair users and disabled persons to overcome the way without much difficulty.

Example of recycling actions:
By means of recycling campaigns, for example, various topics (PET bottles, bottle caps, packaging materials, etc.) can be picked up on a monthly basis, from which new ones are to be created. Collaborations with the local gastronomy and businesses can help collect the free materials. Since Green FabLab is about living and working in harmony with nature, the idea of using "old" materials is a very significant one. By confronting the sustainable and ecological use of resources at an early stage, this idea is internalized for the future. In the future, it can be transferred, used and disseminated to other work areas.

Example of oversized sound play:
A self-made sound made of natural materials creates sounds through the wind or passing people touching it. These sounds and sounds are "different" from the "normal" sounds of the city. There are many different senses to be addressed, but no sensory overload take place.

\subsection{Consideration about the figures}
All of these ideas can be implemented as projects by the university in-house, as the technical understanding should be present. In areas where, for example, craft know-how is needed (for example, when setting up seating), sponsors or companies from the surrounding area may be called on to help. These can help to support or take over the work. Sponsorships or advertisements on the website of the Green FabLab may help offset the "debts".

\section{Aspects of Pleasure after Tessin 2008}

\subsection{Accessibility}
Tessin W. (2008) describes the accessibility of the open space as a consistently important aspect for a pleasant stay. He makes it clear that the population visits the open spaces only under very specific conditions, which are best suited for the respective purpose of residence or "most beautiful". What seems to be beautiful or best suited for the particular observer cannot be defined so simply, since each individual's feelings are shaped by individual previous experience and habits (Tessin 2008).Tessin describes this as: „Der Freiraum wird dadurch attraktiv, dass er günstig zu erreichen ist.“ (Tessin W. 2008, S 45). As an example of this statement, families with children were mentioned here, so that the range of action of children is rather limited. Visiting the open space but a "higher purpose" such as a visit to the park (The visit to the State Garden Show 2020) is a greater effort for the journey in purchasing accepted. In this context, the aspect of accessibility loses its importance. According to Tessin, the factor of cheap accessibility, however, once again plays an essential role for the everyday or frequently used open spaces. For example, it has been found in previous studies that the factor of favorable location and accessibility is considered to be one of the three most important factors in the design of open spaces. The significance is even considered higher than, for example, the pretty design of the open space. This is also clear when one considers that, according to Tessin, the population usually first visits the nearest urban open space, rather than the most beautiful or attractive one.
\subsection{Safety, order and condition}
According to Tessin (2008 p. 46), the aspect of security is considered important across all open space types. It was shown that women felt this aspect much more important than men. Especially with playground visitors the aspect was mentioned far above average (Tessin 2008 p. 46). As a sense of pleasure, Tessin's aspect of security is considered to be central, and a prerequisite for it is that this feeling sets in as a "higher need" at all. However, Ticino also points out that in most inner-city open spaces this aspect of security is largely given and therefore not so much demanded. He therefore makes clear the connection between safety and the condition of the free space. For example, he describes this: „Ungepflegte städtische Freiräume, geprägt durch Müll und Vandalismus, ... schnell als „unsicher“ eingestuft, ...“ The state of a free space was either a reason for visitors to visit the respective place or not to do so (Tessin 2008 p. 47).
\subsection{Decor}
With the equipment of a free space, the entire range of seats, play equipment, water sources, kiosks, lanterns, shaded areas, entertainment, toilets, garbage bins, etc. is meant, which is to help the free space to a higher utility value. The aspect is very important for the sense of well-being, but lies across the space in the importance below the location and convenient accessibility. The importance of equipment elements in open spaces varies according to age. This is particularly important for children and adolescents, as well as for their escorts and the elderly. Tessin (2008 p. 48) describes this as follows: „Die Ästhetik des Angenehmen zielt ja letztlich und ausschließlich auf das eigene Wohlbehagen. Alles das, was dem eigenen Wohlbefinden in einem ganz umfassenden Sinne förderlich ist, wird wohlgefällig wahrgenommen (betrachtet und/oder benutzt), alles Andere nicht.“ (Tessin 2008). This makes it clear that it depends on the very individual equipment, which depends on the person is perceived as pleasant. However, according to Tessin, it should be noted that the useful and the comfortable in the aesthetics of the pleasant always have an important influence. He describes, for example, „... das Angenehme ist dem Nützlichen und Bequemen oft näher als dem Schönen, ....“ (Tessin 2008). Which expresses that if something is practical or a matter is simplified by it, (for example, a trail - which is not necessarily pretty but shortened the way) is considered by accepted from.
\subsection{Function and benefits (use value)}
Tessin (2008 p. 48) describes the utility value of a free space as follows: „Ein angenehmer Ort ist der, an dem man möglichst all das tun kann, was man dort gern tun möchte und sei es gerade, dort nichts zu tun.“ Thus, in his opinion, the usability or the individual benefit of the respective open space can be of crucial importance for one's own interests and can be seen as the core content of the aesthetics of the pleasant. In usability different associations can be derived. Men and younger people more often associate the activity aspect with open spaces, while the majority of outdoor visitors expect "rest" and relaxation. The use value is not only meant to do something in the open space, it means more the individual appropriateness or fit between surface and person, so the visitor gets what he expects or wishes. 
The Ideal Freedom is described by Tessin (2008 p. 50) as follows: „Ein Freiraum ist dann angenehm, wenn er seine Funktion als Ort der Aktivität und/oder der Ruhe, in jedem Fall der Entspannung und Erholung (wie immer man diese für sich selbst wünscht) optimal erfüllt.“  (compatibility).
\subsection{Nature}
Tessin (2008 p. 51) sees nature and landscape as classic places where man can "refuel" his resources. It is the perfect "restorative environments". Thus, across all open space types, the vegetation with trees, perennials and lawns is given an outstanding position in terms of well-being. According to Tessin man follows an inner need for "being outdoors" and "being in the fresh air", which also includes the possibility of the "wide field of vision". Tessin explains the phenomenon of this need by the fact that man has, in the course of time, carried out an ever greater urbanization and compartmentalization in existence, alienating him from the natural environment. In the form of memories and yearnings he harbors these overcome remnants of the past life outdoors (Tessin 2008 p. 51). With the idea of the basic experience of freedom of movement, fresh air and an open view, the bulk of "well-being" in urban space can be summarized as the satisfaction of these basic needs, which are called pleasant, According to Tessin (2008), this satisfaction is present in every free space and corresponds in every sense of the world to restoration.
\subsection{Being away}
Being away
According to Tessin (2008), "being away" describes the condition of "fleeing from everyday life" and diving into a pleasant and restful contrast world. It will describe that certain expectations are built up, such as a change to the usual urban environment, which can manifest itself through sudden silence or the absence of exhaust fumes. The shielding effect of shrubs and trees is also mentioned positively, which let the visitor experience the situation like a kind of oasis. Tessin describes that the change from gray facades to the green of the plants is perceived as particularly pleasant. The contrast to everyday life acts on the visitor like a small escape from the rush into a sacred world.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
Climate Change is destroying our path to sustainability. Ours is a world of looming challenges and increasingly limited resources. Sustainable development offers the best chance to adjust our course’ – Ban Ki-Moon (United Nations, 2012). This issue Ban Ki-Moon, former Secretary-General of the United Nations, mentioned becomes more and more important nowadays. A lot of people have heard about the climate change, but actually do not really know how to deal with it or what to do against it. It is not only a topic the United Nations have to discuss – change begins with every single person.
\\ Regarding to Ban Ki-Moon it is important to support sustainability and environmental education in every city (United Nations, 2013, 2018). Such as in Kamp-Lintfort, a former coal mining city, which has gone through a lot of change during the last decade. In course of the founding of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences in 2009 many students and academics from all over the world came to Kamp-Lintfort. Now the city is facing another big change due to the Landesgartenschau 2020, a huge garden fair that will arise on the old coal mining area – a change from black to green.
\\ In the context of the \textit{Landesgartenschau 2020} a \textit{Green FabLab}(A digital fabrication lab that uses natural resources) will be created in Kamp-Lintfort. Right now there are 1227 FabLabs(As at February 13th 2018 https://www.fablabs.io/labs) around the world, but only one \textit{Green FabLab} which is located in Barcelona. Accordingly this is a very big step for the city. The goal is to make the \textit{Green FabLab} a place where people with different ages and backgrounds can come together to learn about the environment and sustainability such as developing and realizing their own ideas. This is what the Third Mission is about. Besides research and teaching the Third Mission is considered one of the future main duties of universities. Therefore it is mandatory to attract people to the \textit{Green FabLab }and inform them about the possibilities the Green FabLab offers. In accordance to the marketing strategy the Green Movie primarily aims at the target group of a local Kamp-Lintfort citizen who is not familiar with a \textit{FabLab}. Secondary people from the closer region around Kamp-Lintfort are included. More detailed our target group consists of middle-aged adults (30-50 years old) with kids. Also the grandparents are part of the extended target group. To fulfill this challenge we, an interdisciplinary team of four students(three industrial and organizational psychology students and one media and communication informatics student) of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences, are going to create an image film as a part of the marketing strategy – the Green Movie. The following paper contains psychological theories concerning the movie concept, also the procedure and the methods that were used such as the lessons learned and a conclusion.
\section{THEORETICAL BACKGROUND}
Referring to psychological theories our thoughts about effects that can be used to improve the impact of the Green Movie on the audience will be explained in the following.
\subsection{ATTITUDES}
Following the ABC model (Rosenberg \& Hovland, 1960) attitudes consist of three components. If someone is confronted with an object the attitude is depending on i) the affective level (sympathy / antipathy) ii) the behavioral level (approach / avoidance) and iii) the cognitive level (positive / negative rating). This is the basis of every attitude.
\\ Based on the ABC model there were some studies regarding the Yale Attitude Change Approach, which examined persuasive communication. Persuasive communication is deduced from the latin word persuadere which means to sway somebody and has the purpose to influence somebodies thinking or behavior. This is possible in different ways:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The source of the message \\
	Credible speakers are more likely to convince somebody of their attitude (Hovland \& Weiss 1951; Jain \& Posavac 2000). This is the reason why we chose the current mayor of Kamp-Lintfort, Mr. Christoph Landscheidt, for our movie interview. In the last years he changed a lot in Kamp-Lintfort concerning the process from a coal mining city to a university city. Because of that he has a great standing in Kamp-Lintfort.
	\item Characteristics of the message \\
	Messages are more convincible if they do not seem as a manipulation (Petty \& Cacioppo 1986). This is the reason why we do not try to influence our target group too aggressively by exaggerating with too high expectations for the Landesgartenschau 2020. Furthermore there is an effect called ‘start and end effect’ which describes the phenomenon that people only memorize the aspects they hear first and last because those are the parts to which they pay the most attention. Due to that we tried to keep the Green Movie short and the scenes for the beginning and the end are mindfully chosen.
	\item Characteristics of the recipient \\
	Referring to Festinger and Maccoby (1964) a distracted audience is easier to convince than a focused one. We are aware of the fact that the people we want to reach with this image film do not visit the Landesgartenschau 2020 just to watch our Green Movie (It is not only planned to show the Green Movie at the Landesgartenschau 2020, we also want to distribute it through different other channels we do not know yet.). In this case we have to deal with a target group which is not focused on watching our image film, furthermore a distracted group of people has to be handled. Additionally it is easier to influence non-academic people than academic people (Rhodes \& Wood, 1992). According to our target group, which is the typical average Kamp-Lintfort citizen who is not an academic, this theory supports our concept.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{ELABORATION LIKELIHOOD MODEL}
Petty and Cacioppo (1986) developed the elaboration likelihood model that describes two routes how people can be influenced – the central and the peripheral route. The central route is more successful when people are focused and able to face up to arguments. This means that facts and fundamental knowledge has to be used to influence people via the central route. If the audience is distracted the chance for a successful persuasion is significant higher by using the peripheral route. Therefore affective and emotional cues have to be used (Fabrigar \& Petty 1999, Snyder \& DeBono 1989). Because the Green Movie partly aims at distracted people we want to use emotional cues. For example showing the former RAG area to attach the citizens who could be bound to this area because of its magnificent influence on the townscape.
\subsection{ATTRACTION}
The genesis of attraction is possible through different methods. People can feel attracted just because of vicinity (Festinger, Schachter \& Back, 1950). We want to use this effect to attract our target group by showing citizens of Kamp-Lintfort and the well-known RAG area in the image film. The second way to attract people is to show resemblance (Newcomb, 1961). If people see others with the same demographic background they feel attracted to them. This resemblance effect is also given with the same proficiency group (Kubitschek \& Hallinan, 1998) and a similar communication style (Burleson et al., 1996). Regarding to those effects typical local people in the city center of Kamp-Lintfort will be interviewed and shown in the movie.
\subsection{CONVERSATIONAL MAXIMS}
The concept of the Green Movie is based on the four conversational maxims proposed by Grice (1975). According to the author a speaker is assumed to make a contribution that follows certain rules to reach the conversational purpose (Röhner \& Schütz, 2012). First a message should be adequately but not overly informative (quantity maxim). That is why we decided to keep the image film simple by only sharing basic, easily understandable information about all scientific aspects. In addition we tried to keep the information and communication style clear, unambiguous, brief, and orderly to fulfill the maxim of manner. To ensure the quality maxim we are only using facts that are true or supported by evidence to attract the viewers to the \textit{Green FabLab}. Also the content of the movie should be relevant for the audience (maxim of relation or relevance), so we tried to emphasize the actuality of the \textit{Green FabLab} and the Landesgartenschau 2020 such as the positive impact it can have on the city as well as on the citizens.
\subsection{PRINCIPLES OF PERSUASION}
According to Cialdini (2009) there are six principles to create conditions to influence people. The first one is social proof, which states that people will do things that they see other people are doing. Referring to that principle, we are showing different people with different backgrounds sharing their opinions and thoughts about the \textit{Green FabLab} and why they would go there. Another key principle of persuasion is authority. People will tend to obey authority figures because they are perceived as competent. Especially if they do not have a lot of knowledge regarding a certain subject, people rely on external signs. Using that strategy for our image film, the mayor of Kamp-Lintfort will be interviewed at the RAG area telling the people to visit and explore the future \textit{Green FabLab}.
Additionally people are more likely to follow advices if they are offered by authorities or people they like. Liking is also an important principle of persuasion. We are trying to arise sympathy with the self-enhancement and impression management from the moderator in the movie. By highlighting the positive appearance of the moderator and others shown in the Green Movie, favorable feelings in the audience should be created. That is a relevant aspect to make people feel attracted.
Furthermore we are emphasizing the fact that the \textit{Green FabLab} is a place for everybody. That is why a feminine biracial moderator was chosen and different people with different ages are shown in the image film. Thereby it should be expressed that everybody can be interested in science. Not only professors or academics are supposed to visit the \textit{Green FabLab} and all kinds of people, cultures and social classes are welcome. This way stereotyping, which often occurs unconsciously and persistent (Aronson, Wilson \& Akert, 2008), should be prevented.
\subsection{SELF-EFFICACY}
In psychological terms the conviction of being able to influence the achieving of ones goals is called self-efficacy. If a person thinks she / he is able to fulfill a specific task her / his self-efficacy concerning this task is high and vice versa (Bandura, 1977, 1994). The problem regarding the \textit{FabLab} and probably the upcoming\textit{ Green FabLab }could be that most of the people link it with the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences. Due to this connection, they assume that they are not authorized to enter it. Furthermore most of the average regional citizens think that they are not able to work with the ‘high-tech’ machines there. But actually they are more than welcomed to try everything. It is the main goal to make people come to the \textit{Green FabLab} and enable them to learn, experience, repair or invent whatever they want. Through our image film we want to embrace the audience to visit the \textit{Green FabLab} and to become a part of it.
\subsection{DUAL-CODING THEORY}
Learning is an everyday process of human beings. In his dual-coding theory Paivio (1971) postulated two ways of learning: Learning through verbal codes and learning through visual codes.
Remembering something gets easier if it is coded both verbal and visual. This is one reason we chose to make this image film about the\textit{ Green FabLab}. With a movie a visual image of the \textit{Green FabLab} and a verbal image can be transferred. Thereby the chance that people learn about the Green FabLab and recognize it after watching the movie rises (for example in comparison to a radio advertisement).
\subsection{MERE-EXPOSURE-EFFECT}
The Mere-Exposure-Effect, first described 1968 by Zajonc, is a theory about attraction. It proposes that the more often a stimulus is presented to someone, the higher the chance of the person developing a preference for the stimulus. In conclusion: The more often a person watches the movie about the\textit{ Green FabLab}, the more rises the tendency of the person liking it. We want to use this effect by publishing the film on various channels. That way potential visitors are more likely to see the Green Movie. The effect is limited by the general attitude of a person to the stimulus. If it is a negative stimulus just the negativity increases (Swap, 1977). Only if it is a neutral or positive stimulus, the chance of liking it rises. Due to the fact that most of the people don’t have an association with the name \textit{Green FabLab} the stimulus in form of the film should be neutral for them.
\subsection{MASS COMMUNICATION}
As the name already implies mass communication can reach a broad mass of people. It has multiple impact possibilities and dispersive receivers. Furthermore mass communication has to be differentiated from individual communication. Mass communication is always directed to two or more people, whereas individual communication describes that only one person at a time is addressed. Another benefit of the mass medium ‘movie’ we chose to produce, is the easy opportunity of distribution it contains (Röhner \& Schütz, 2012).
\subsection{CONTACT HYPOTHESIS}
The\textit{ Green FabLab} is supposed to be a place where everybody can come together, explore, learn, discuss, design, produce and have fun. It should be exciting, inspiring and enabling people to repair or invent whatever they like. According to Allport (1954) stereotypes, prejudices and hostility can emerge if different groups of society come together. Properly managed contact between groups should prevent and reduce these problems and lead to better interactions. To obtain beneficial effects, the situation must include positive contact. Some of the criteria for that are equal status, common goals, intergroup cooperation and the support of authorities. This psychological theory fits perfectly to the \textit{Green FabLab}: People who go there can get support by the expertise of the authorities from the institution but everybody has an equal status, no matter how familiar he or she is with scientific topics. In addition superordinate common goals will be followed in the \textit{Green FabLab}, so the intergroup cooperation is necessary. Through this intergroup contact a general improvement of the relations between different people occurs, because they get to know members of other society groups. That also helps to reduce anxiety, scepticism and doubts. \\ With the Green Movie we want to express that different people with different backgrounds can actively get a project going. Additionally it should be emphasized that the visitors can get in touch with other interesting people, make friends and exchange their ideas or problems.
\section{PROCEDURE \& METHOD}
After the decision of producing an image film we thought about psychological theories that we can use to make the Green Movie a good image film. Those theories are mentioned in the chapter above. In the beginning of the project we met with two people of Campus TV which is an institution that offers students coaching and consulting for filming projects. After they gave us a crash course in how to do a film project we started to make all necessary preparations. First we created a movie concept and developed a storyboard. Then we continued with filming trials at different locations and constructing questions for street interviews and for the interview with the mayor of Kamp-Lintfort. While making preparations we visited the old RAG area with all its abandoned buildings to get a more intense insight. Because of our target group which is deeply enrooted with the former coal mining location we wanted to learn more about the history of the RAG area. Peter Wylenzek, the last coal miner in Germany from the left side of the Rhine showed us around and told us detailed about the impressive history of the RAG area.
Concerning the sequences in the \textit{FabLab} with filming the machines, the time lapse of the sunrise, the interview with the mayor and the drone flight were our most time-consuming tasks. In the meantime we also created a Google Earth animation and made contact with Jonathan Minchin, the responsible person of the \textit{Green FabLab} in Barcelona. Later we went there and took some film footage of the \textit{Green FabLab}. With all the recorded sequences we started the postproduction including the reviewing and selecting of our filmed sequences, cutting, composing music and recording the voice-over.
\subsection{FILMING}
The following chapter will give some guidance on how to film. In particular it contains tips for a cameraman and a moderator on how to film and act in order to achieve the best result. This will be an interesting chapter for people considering to do something similar like we did within the framework of our interdisciplinary project.
\subsubsection{CAMERAMAN}
Using the following pictures some helpful tips for a cameraman will be explained. In Figure D.1 two simple mistakes can be seen. First: The person is placed in the middle of the picture. A better camera angle would show the interview partner in the right or left corner of the picture. Mostly you film interviews like that because the outcome is more comfortable to watch for the future audience.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figd1.jpg}
		\caption{BAD EXAMPLE OF THE PICTURE FRAME}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
The second mistake concerns the visible microphone in the picture. Due to the fact that it is a directional microphone, there is no need of holding it close to the mouth of the interviewed person. The audio does not get affected if it is further away from the person. If the microphone is shown in the screen, it could distract the viewer from the rest of the film. Not just because it is an object which is suddenly appearing
Figure D.2 shows a better way of filming. The person of interest is located slightly in the right corner of the picture and the microphone is not visible in the screen.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figd2.jpg}
		\caption{GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE PICTURE FRAME}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
in the screen but also because the label of the brand is visible on the microphone. This could distract the viewer.
\subsubsection{MODERATOR}
When it comes to recording interview sequences it is necessary for the person who interviews the people, also called the moderator, to consider some aspects.
First of all it is important, that the interviewer always stays close to the cameraman during an interview. The shoulders of these two persons should touch each other. The main reason for that is that the interviewed person mostly looks at the moderator. So if the cameraman and the interviewer are standing too far away from each other, the angle between the interviewed person and the camera increases on the horizontal axis. In general it looks better if the person does not look directly into the camera but close beside it (Fig. D.2). If the angle between the camera and the interviewed person gets too big it is more likely to look strange for the audience (Fig. D.1). To put it in a nutshell: During the interview the moderator should stay close to the cameraman, so the horizontal angle between them decreases and the filmed sequence looks good.
Another aspect which affects the vertical angle of the interviewed person to the camera is the height of the interviewed person. This is important to be considered by the interviewer and the cameraman.
If the interviewed person is shorter than the cameraman or the interviewer, they should change their position for example by kneeling down. Otherwise the interviewed person would constantly look up which could cause an unappealing picture. It is better if the interviewer adjusts his position rather than that the interviewed person has to adapt.
\subsubsection{EQUIPMENT}
In order to record the various scenes for the Green Movie we used different equipment for different sequences. The following chapter explains what exactly has been used. Therefore technical equipment or software will be described pointing out the different advantages or disadvantages.
For most of the sequences in the image film we used the Camcorder Canon XH A1s. We used it to film most of the sequences of the Green Movie: the street interviews, the interview with the mayor of Kamp-Lintfort, the time lapse of the sunrise and different scenes of the RAG area. On the one hand the camcorder has some advantages in comparison to a smartphone camera. First of all it contains a very good stabilizer. That is why even if the camera is not standing on a tripod the picture mostly looks calmer and steadier than for example being carried on the shoulder which was necessary for the interviews in the streets of Kamp-Lintfort. Additionally the camcorder Canon XH A1s has two audio ports. This advantage enabled us to simply plug in the microphone into the camera. Due to this we did not have to combine the audio and video afterwards. This simplified the postproduction just as the actual shooting because we did not need a clapperboard. Another reason choosing the camcorder Canon XH A1s was the good focal distance of 4,5 - 90 mm. It allowed us to film objects in a far distance like for example the bulldozer in the film. Since the RAG area is a very huge area it was important to have a decent optical zoom as well as a tripod. We used a common tripod on which we were able to mount the camera. It was variable in height and very useful for filming the different time lapse, the interview with the mayor or general objects in far distances. \\ On the other hand, the camcorder also has some disadvantages. Due its tape-based recording technique it was difficult to import the recordings to the computer. With a tape-based camera it is only possible to play the videotapes at normal speed. Otherwise the computer cannot record it and subsequently transform it into a common digital format like MP4. Furthermore videotapes are more vulnerable to damage in comparison to SD cards, which are used in more modern cameras. There is a high probability that the tape can break down. Usually the recording time with videotapes is more limited than with a SD card. Moreover someone of the filming crew has to pay attention while using videotapes because if you watch an older scene again directly on the camera screen you have to fast-forward the videotape again to the point where it is still empty. Otherwise the camera would overwrite the so far recorded material. This could be critical because once a tape is overwritten there is no chance of getting the old material back. As mentioned above a tape-based camera has some disadvantages in comparison to a camera which is for example SD-card based. But due to the fact that we did not have other resources we had to use it. If you pay attention to all the mentioned aspects it can work as good as an SD-card based camera.
\\ To record the Green Movie the following type of videotape was used: TDK DVN-60 Mini-DV.
\\ To film the interview sequences of the Green Movie we used Røde’s directional microphone NTG-2. As already mentioned a directional microphone offers a better sound quality because it only records the sound of the direction where it is pointed at. This enables the person who is recording the audio to hide disturbing noises by pointing the microphone in another direction. Besides that it allows you to avoid showing the microphone in the picture because there is no need of holding it close to the mouth of the interviewed person.
\\ To adjust the volume of the microphone we used the Sennheiser HD 201 headphones. By plugging them into the camera we were able to get a better sound quality of the recorded voices.
\\ Additionally we filmed a lot of scenes with other cameras than the Canon XH A1s. The air footage of the RAG area was filmed with a drone. In collaboration with a professional drone pilot (Arno Ingenlath, Gesellschaft für Schaden- und Sicherheitsanalysen) we filmed an overview of the former coal mining area and especially the winding tower. It is important to know that in order to record film footage with a drone usually you need two people. In our case it was better for the footage because one person only concentrated on filming while the other person just steered the drone. The drone we used is called DJI Inspire 2. It has a compact Super 35 camera with an integrated gimbal called Zenmuse X7 mounted on. Following lens was mounted on the Zenmuse X7: DL-S 16mm F2.8 ND ASPH.
\\ To film a time lapse of the \textit{FabLab} in Kamp-Lintfort we used an action camera. The name of the camera is Victure Action Camera and it has a resolution of 14 megapixel. We used it because it could easily be put on a shelf so the whole \textit{FabLab} could be seen. Furthermore it had a fish eye lens which as well contributed the purpose of filming an overview.
\\ The third camera we used to film was the one from an iPhone 6s. We used this one especially for scenes where we needed a mobile and easily moveable camera. Because the camcorder is very heavy and bulky we were not able to take it with us to Barcelona, Spain. It would have been complicated with the flight and insurance. Although we just filmed the scenes at the \textit{Green FabLab }in Barcelona with an iPhone 6s there is no loss in the quality of the captured images. Both the camcorder as well as the iPhone 6s record motion pictures with a resolution of 1080p. An important aspect of filming a movie with different cameras (especially with smartphone cameras) is the frame rate. The majority of mobile phones captures movies with a frame rate of 30 frames per second by default. On the contrary current cameras or camcorders use the common frame rate of 25 frames per second which is appropriate for cinema movies. It is very important that every sequence is captured with exactly the same frame rate. If you do not take care of this the various scenes cannot be cut into one movie. There are some techniques to adjust the frame rate of movies but they are not very appropriate or recommendable. Instead you should just pay attention to the frame rate settings of each particular device. Before recording one person should be responsible for the preferred frame rate in which all sequences should be taken and accordingly ensure that the filming device is correctly set. Usually filming with 25 frames per second is enough. As already mentioned most of today’s cinema movies are captured with 25 frames per seconds for a standard film. That is totally sufficient for normal purposes. If you want to film with a camera of a smartphone we can highly recommend you to download an extra video recording app. Most of the times the apps which are installed by factory default do not offer adjustable frame rate settings. Furthermore special filming apps have built-in a better picture stabilizer than most of the factory apps. Due to a better picture stabilizer the movie looks smoother and calmer. To film single sequences of our movie with an iPhone 6s we installed the application ProCam 5 on it. The QR-Code in Figure D.3 will direct you to the iOS App Store. Since we have not installed the App on an android device, we have no experience with the Android Play Store equivalent.
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
\\ Other useful tools we used, which made filming with a mobile phone easier were a simple selfie stick and a professional gimbal. For some sequences like for example the machines in the \textit{FabLab} Kamp-Lintfort we were able to use a gimbal for mobile phones called DJI Osmo Mobile. Its three-axis stabilizing system allowed us to record sequences which looked nearly as calm as the ones filmed with the camera standing on a tripod. This effect results because the gimbal keeps the mobile phone, which gets plugged into it, steady. The shaking of the hand or other eruptions are controlled by the gimbal, so the picture stays steady. But there is also a cheaper version if you are not able to purchase such an expensive gimbal. A selfie stick calms the picture just the same. While using it you have to keep your elbow and one end of the stick close to your body. So you have a stable position for filming which can reduce the shaking of the picture tremendously. That is a simple trick we learned to improve smooth and non-shaking filming.
\subsection{POST PRODUCTION}
After filming the raw material had to be edited. In the following it is described what kind of tools we used and how we proceeded.
\subsubsection{CUT}
For cutting we used the program Adobe Premiere Pro CS5.5. We proceeded as followed: First the different scenes were sorted to fit our storyboard. Afterwards we decided which sequence fits best for each specific scene. Next we did some fine tuning by smoothening the transitions. After this we implemented the music. The music was produced by ourselves using the program Ableton Live 9 lite. In order to create the beat we used a MIDI keyboard. Producing the music on your own has the big advantage that nobody can claim his or her rights on the music. Finally the voice-over was implemented. How it was produced is described in the following passage.
\subsubsection{VOICE-OVER RECORDING}
To record the male voice which can be heard in the background we used simple tricks to get a better result. It is important to have a silent surrounding during the recording. Therefore we recorded the voice under a blanket. If you do not have access to a professional recording studio that is a simple trick to reduce the noise pollution of the recording. Recording audio in a wardrobe or a good isolated car can have a similar positive effect on the quality of the recording.
\section{LESSONS LEARNED}
In the following chapter the experiences and lessons we learned during the interdisciplinary project producing the Green Movie will be summarized. It is not supposed to be a strict handbook about how to do an image film. Instead it should give some helpful advice. Hereby we would like to act in accordance with the sharing and open source philosophy of the \textit{FabLab} movement and share our lessons learned to the public.
\\ Like in almost every project management the planning and organization part was the most important one of the project. This does not mean that we had a strict or narrow plan we were following. Furthermore the Green Movie Project showed us that although it is important to have a good plan, it is even more important to have a better plan B.
\\ To start chronologically: First we had the idea of making an image film for the upcoming \textit{Green FabLab} in Kamp-Lintfort. Because we have not done an image film like this before we talked to a lot of people, which turned out to be really important for us. Because as we talked to people and explained our idea we received great advices, new ideas, new contact persons, helpful support, useful equipment and a lot more. But nonetheless it is necessary to be proactive. You will not achieve anything just by waiting for it. Instead you have to do the first step and ask for opportunities.
\\ Because an image film is a lot of work we had to deal with a lot of different persons. That included for example the mayor, marketing people, owners and workers of the RAG area, people of the \textit{FabLab}, Campus TV and a lot more. Usually we were the people who wanted them to do something for us. That is the reason why it was important for us to stay in good communication with them, make exact appointments and give them deadlines. If something takes too long you have to contact above mentioned people multiple times. Moreover we had to deal a lot with bureaucratic paperwork which was not always easy to understand and also took some time to be signed by all responsible persons. From this experience we learned that the information flow between different stakeholders can take a long time and you have to be proactive. Additionally we experienced the relevance of making appointments early enough to avoid time delays or cancellations.
Although we scheduled the appointments early and did a good planning we could not influence everything. That is the reason why we had to come up with a plan B for everything and we needed to be flexible and spontaneous. Some examples:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We did not want to show snow or bad weather in the Green Movie, which is not easy in December in Germany. Once we had a period of two weeks without sunshine in Kamp-Lintfort. After that we had to be really spontaneous and use every chance of filming with good weather.
	\item In total we made four appointments for an interview with the mayor of Kamp-Lintfort and he had to cancel all of them. The fifth appointment was successful, but then it was snowing and we could not film outside at the RAG area how it was planned. We had to realize our plan B and record the interview inside the university building in front of a green wall.
	\item The responsible person for the drone filming suddenly informed us that he has time to do a test flight but we have to be at the RAG area in 60 min. We agreed spontaneously and he did the test flight with us. Later it turned out that the test flight was the only drone flight we could do due to the weather and time circumstances, so we used those scenes from the test flight for the final movie.
	\item As soon as we heard that it would be possible to do an excursion to the \textit{Green FabLab} Barcelona we directly started to investigate how we can realize that trip. If we would not have contacted the right persons and filled out the paperwork, the excursion could not have happened that fast.
\end{itemize}
Concerning the filming we learned that we have to take care of a lot. Besides the complex guidance of how to film, post-produce or be a moderator we had to consider some legal bases like for example the filming authorization for the RAG area or the declaration of consent. This is not always the first thing that comes to your mind but it is definitely important for your own coverage. Our essential motto regarding the film material was ‘It is better to have it and don’t need it, than to need it and don’t have it’ because you never know what a sequence you filmed could be good for. Of course we planned our scenes in advance but there is always a problem or a chance that may affect your movie. This possibility of change we called ‘the journey of the movie’. You know where and mostly how your journey has to end, but you cannot plan every detail of the journey in advance so you just have to work with the circumstances and make the best out of it.
\section{CONCLUSION}
We have evolved a lot through the journey of researching, interviewing and film production for the Green Movie. In the process we did not only learn a lot about the \textit{FabLab} and the \textit{Green FabLab }but also about technology, society, nature, sustainability, movies and media. To put it in a nutshell: creating the Green Movie was a great experience. To describe our personal development during the production of the movie it can be said that in the beginning we could not really imagine how a \textit{Green FabLab} could be like or what it really is about. Meanwhile we consider ourselves passionate about it. The hospitable and inspiring way in which the \textit{Green FabLab Barcelona} received us and shared everything with us (containing knowledge, self-planted food, etc.) strengthened our wholehearted commitment to the Green Movie project even more. Hence we think that concerning the future \textit{Green FabLab} there can be learned a lot from the one in Barcelona. The people there are really open-minded and keen to share not only the knowledge of the latest technologies they use but also how it should be used sensible and sustainable. Moreover they are a lot of aspects the upcoming \textit{Green FabLab} in Kamp-Lintfort can assume concerning for example the \textit{Third Mission}. Projects to cure a lot of problems are already implemented and they are steadily in touch with society and nature. Therefore the cooperation between them should be maintained and projects should be realized together.
It was a challenge to summarize so many impressions, experiences and information into a short and understandable image and information film. But we did our best to make it work by for example composing our own music or filming sunsets early in the morning.
Now we hope that the Green Movie will release the expected effects on the audience and make them enthusiastic and excited for the \textit{Green FabLab} so that they will appear numerously. Convinced that the \textit{Green FabLab} will not only enrich the city Kamp-Lintfort but also its citizens, we are curious how far the technology will have progressed until 2020 and what can be implemented during and after the \textit{Landesgartenschau 2020} at the RAG area.

Authors: \\ Esther Rosenbaum (19737)\\ Vanessa Vieweg (19605)\\ Maren Quix (19484)
\section{Horticultural Show 2020 (Esther Rosenbaum)}
The Green FabLab is an institution,which will be implemented in the horticultural show in 2020 in Kamp-Lintfort. A horticultural show is an exhibition for gardening and represents a development in form of sustainable urban development and municipally major projects for the holding city.
Furthermore, a horticultural show is a national and image supporting large-scale event, combined with aspects of culture, music and art. Overall objectives of an horticultural show are to improve the quality of life and the environmental quality in the cities, as well as to create meeting points and cultural places of exchange for all generations (Wettbewerbsdokumentation, 2017). In 2020, the horticultural show will take place in Kamp-Lintfort and will include historical roots of the city, such as the monastery Kamp and the West mine and represents the future-oriented city with its modern campus of the Rhine- Waal University of Applied Sciences (Landesgartenschau 2020 in Kamp-Lintfort, 2017). 
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics{fige1.jpg}
		\caption{Catchment Area of the horticultural show}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
With expected visitors of 560.000 and the show’s close proximity to the Netherlands and Belgium, the number of visitors can be even increasing. The Green FabLab will benefit from the horticultural show and its prominence, in form of publications and visitors. The Marketing Strategy of the horticultural show in Kamp- Lintfort includes the protection of the word-/figurative brand, the usage of a mascot, a communication campaign as well as a potential analysis of visitors. In detail, the communication campaign includes a student competition,for designing banners and flags. Furthermore, to promote the horticultural show in 2020, the city enables days of action and marketing instruments, such as Public Relations and Social Media. Regarding the target group and possible visitors, the potential analysis shows a potential of visitors of up to 845.000 in a radius of 120 km around Kamp- Lintfort. The Marketing Strategy of the Green FabLab adapts to the potential analysis of the horticultural show and will benefit from the overall event, in form of visitors in Kamp- Lintfort, who will then be appealed with advertisement of the Green FabLab.
\section{Introduction Marketing Strategy (Maren Quix)}
The interdisciplinary project „FabLab Goes Green: Conceptual Framework, Technical Design and Marketing Strategy“ deals with developing, building and evaluating a Green FabLab. The development of an appropriate Marketing Strategy for a Green FabLab, located in Kamp-Lintfort, will be worked out in the following sections. To guarantee that all readers are starting with the same basic knowledge about the project, first of all the project itself and its overall objectives, goals and the mission will be presented. Afterwards, a definition of the Green FabLab and an introduction about the horticultural show „Landesgartenschau 2020“, in which context the Green FabLab is set up, will be provided. \\ The name of the interdisciplinary project „FabLab Goes Green: Conceptual Framework, Technical Design and Marketing Strategy“ already clarifies the main intentions of this project. Goal is to design the central Green FabLab building and the development of an accompanying strategy for communication and marketing. The university has the possibility to use an area of 7000 square meters to design the conceptual framework and built up the Green Fablab with its garden and
surrounding area. In specific, the goals of the interdisciplinary project are the development of concepts and ideas for the architectural concept of the central Green FabLab building, the efficient manipulation of in-house microclimate, the utilization of floor space for the Green FabLab building,
the minimal technical endowment of a Green FabLab, the utilization and design of open spaces, the advancements of possible projects, and the communication and Marketing Strategy of the Green FabLab. \\
To come to the definition of the Green FabLab it is first of all important to define a FabLab in General. The term FabLab is the abbreviation for „Fabrication Laboratory“ and is defined as a place where nearly everything can be created (Media Computing Group, 2014). The FabLab is based on
the desire, to be able to turn ideas into real things and to be able to do it by oneself. So, the FabLab is a lab for fabrication, which is accessible for the broad public, filled with manufacturing machines like 3D Printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, milling machines and a lot more. These machines are able to produce objects by printing, cutting, or milling objects from data files without human
intervention (Walter-Herrmann and Büching, 2013). When taking a look into the past, the tendency of a cheaper and easier production technology can be identified after several years. In the 1950s, most of the produced computers were huge, expensive, slow, and mainly usable for business
companies, in the 1980s computers became a standardized consumer product and today a computer is available in nearly every household, easy to handle and used in everyday life (Ceruzzi, 2003).\\
Conveying this technical development to the vision of digital manufacturing a FabLab is
representing, it can be suggested that this kind of fabrication will become more popular, more
important and maybe more affordable for everyone in the future.
The FabLab in Kamp-Lintfort in specific has the intention to familiarize pupils, students, founders
and corporations with modern manufacturing technology and to give the possibility to realize these
own ideas. Since the FabLab in Kamp-Lintfort wants to foster the contact with modern
technologies, there is access to the FabLab beyond the lectures. In the near future even the
population should get access to the Fabrication Laboratory to guarantee and create a most
interdisciplinary environment of different social groups in Kamp-Lintfort (FabLab Kamp-Lintfort,
n.d.). \\ When a FabLab is representing a place, where researchers can work under the slogan “How to make
almost everything” a Green FabLab is extending this motto by including the field of environmental
and agricultural research. It should be created a creative environment where economy, technology,
environment and sustainability are collaborating. (Rhine-Waal University, 2017)
A Marketing Strategy is necessary to ensure that this new type of laboratory will be seen by the
brought public as watchable and usable place to be. It is important to bring closer the definition of
the FabLab so that the fabrication laboratory and especially the Green FabLab, is not seen as
something abstract any more, where general citizens don’t have access to and which they can’t use.
Main element for creating such an awareness is to familiarize people with the Green FabLab. By
doing so, the potential customers will develop a feeling and a perception of how the Green FabLab
can be used in a favorable way for them. Furthermore, they are not deterred by the complex and
new technology if they are already possessing some knowledge and insights about the Green
FabLab. \\ Besides this a Marketing Strategy always has the intention to create brand awareness in general by
promoting the brand through with several communication tools. The marketing strategy is
supporting the image the Green FabLab wants to present, the identity and the values they want to be
associated with. How the marketing mix will be used to reach these milestones, will be explained in
a later part of this paper.
\\ In general it can be said that the structure of the marketing strategy is based on the advantages and
the uniqueness, which the Green FabLab is offering. Regarding the possibilities the Green FabLab
has, a target group can be defined. In the case of the target group, the visitors of the horticultural show in 2020 need to be taken into consideration as well although they might be potential
customers only for a short period of time.
\\ With analyzing the strength and weaknesses and the definition of the target group of the Green
FabLab, the goals and milestones which are reachable can be set. It is important that every step
which will be executed by the Green FabLab, or by someone who is acting in charge of the Green
FabLab, always corresponds to the message the brand wants to convey. This message has to be in
line with the image, the identity and the values the brand wants to represent to the public. Further
details regarding the strategy can be find in the following sections.
\section{Unique Selling Proposition (Vanessa Vieweg)}
The establishment of an unique selling proposition belongs to the basics of marketing. The Unique
Selling Proposition belongs to the product orientation phase. This phase was active between 1940
and 1950. The American scientist Rosser Reeves developed the concept of the “Unique Selling
Proposition” in this time frame. Reeves explained that the characteristics of the products builds up
an advantage for the customer. This advantage should be unique and supported by selected
advertisement. (Schnettler, J., Wendt, G., 2011, p. 11) \\ For the Green FabLab, which is not a tangible product but an institution, the Unique Selling
Proposition has to be defined. The uniqueness of the Green FabLab is defined by different factors.
One factor is the green aspect of the Green FabLab: the focus on innovations for economic friendly
and sustainable alternatives for energy and water treatments. Another aspect is the location of the
Green FabLab. It is positioned during and after the “Landesgartenschau” in Kamp-Lintfort in an
created landscape to attract visitors. The added value for the people that visit the Green FabLab is
another important aspect of the uniqueness. The second factor is the diversity that counts to the
uniqueness of the Green FabLab. People from different cultures are welcome and can contribute to
the different work that is presented in the Green FabLab. Creative ideas should be established in
interdisciplinary teamwork. The cross-generational aspect can also contribute to the ideas of the
Green FabLab and people from all generations will get added value. The fact, that the sustainability
of alternatives for energy and water treatments affect people around the globe from different
cultures, will connect the visitors of the Green FabLab. The third factor is the modernity of the
Green FabLab. Due to the fact, that the Green FabLab is connected to the Rhine-Waal University of
Applied Sciences, the machines and processes can be optimized with the help of the offerings from
the university and its professors and international students. To ensure the sustainability of the presented concepts of energy and water treatments, the application of the newest technology is
required. With the help of new technologies more inventions for green alternatives can be
established. Setting trends of sustainable methods for renewable energies is an aspect that is also
important for the Green FabLab. It can become a forerunner for economic friendly energy and water
treatments and act exemplary. The combination of these three factors green, diversity and modernity
are the characteristics that make the Green FabLab to an unique institution. The different aspects of
the three factors will attract many people to visit the Green FabLab and to implement their ideas.
The Unique Selling Proposition is with these three factors defined and will help to improve the
marketing strategy of the Green FabLab in the future.
\section{Marketing Analysis (Vanessa Vieweg)}
The implementation of marketing measures need the establishment of a marketing plan. The
marketing plan should consists of four elements. The first element is the specification of the
marketing aims. The second element is the formulation of a marketing strategy. Details of the
organization of the marketing mix, is the third element. The last element consists of the details for
the implementation and control of the marketing measures. The division of the marketing aims, the
development of the marketing strategy and the planing of the measures to implement the strategy,
can only take place on the basis of a particular marketing analysis. In a marketing analysis very
general factors are researched. The marketing analysis starts with the analysis of the environmental
factors and ends with the analysis of the business in comparison to its main competitors. In the
analysis of the environmental factors the general environment, in which the affected institution is
positioned and all impacts on the institution will be examined. (Schnettler, J., Wendt, G., 2011, p.
37-38) \\ The institution of the Green FabLab will be positioned during and after the Landesgartenschau in
Kamp-Lintfort. Kamp-Lintfort belongs to the district of Wesel and to the administrative district of
Düsseldorf, in North-Rhine Westphalia. Even though the time of the coal and steel industry is over,
North-Rhine Westphalia is still an important factor for the economy and Europe. The “Friedrich-
Heinrich” mine in Kamp-Lintfort closed in December 2012. North-Rhine Westphalia obtained
about 4.6 percent of the European gross domestic product every year and is one of the most
important economic region in Europe. 16 of 50 lucrative companies in Germany are based in North-
Rhine Westphalia, with 8 DAX concerns. The half of all workplaces exists of industrial production
and service providers. North-Rhine Westphalia disposed over the thickest road system of the country. With the large airports of Düsseldorf and Köln-Bonn, North-Rhine Westphalia has more
than two turnstiles with international connections. Another advantage is the binding to the big
seaports in Antwerpen and Rotterdam in the Netherlands, over the Rhine or by rail. The biggest
river port is in Duisburg, which is very close to Kamp-Lintfort. The rate of unemployment is still
high in North-Rhine Westphalia. With 8.3 percent the rate lies around one quarter higher than the
federal average. (Pauler, 2015) \\ For the Green FabLab the favourable condition of the international connections is a positive aspect
to attract visitors and partners for the Green FabLab from different countries. The inventions and
processes for sustainable and economic friendly energy and water treatments from the Green
FabLab can spread out all over the world. The visitors and partners from different countries and
cultures will gain new information and can contribute to further projects of the Green FabLab. The
importance of the sustainability will be communicate to different cultures. Due to the fact, that
many big and successful companies are located in North-Rhine Westphalia, the Green FabLab is
positioned in a competitive high area. A positive aspect of many companies in this area is that the
technology is proceeded in this area. It can be used as an advantage for cooperation or partnerships
with companies to guarantee the ongoing production in the Green FabLab. The exportation of
machines or other goods is ensured through the biggest river port in Duisburg.
\subsection{SWOT Analysis (Vanessa Vieweg)}
The SWOT-Analysis is a combination of the opportunity-risk-analysis and the strength-weaknessanalysis.
The opportunity-risk-analysis consists of the external factors of the environmental- and
industry-analysis. These factors can not be influenced, but they are important for the concept of the
marketing strategy and for the marketing measures. In the strength-weakness-analysis the
advantages and disadvantages are examined to the main competitors of the business. These factors
are internal factors. In the SWOT-analysis the external and internal factors are combined and the
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats are collected for the affected institution. The
aspects that belong to the strength and opportunities are helpful for the institution and the aspects
that belong to the weakness and threats are harmful for the institution. The aspects are illustrated in
a matrix. (Schnettler, J., Wendt, G., 2011, p. 46-48) 
\subsection{SWOT Matrix (Vanessa Vieweg)}
Different aspects were considered for the establishment of the SWOT-analysis for the Green
FabLab. One strength of the Green FabLab is the uniqueness. It is a digital fabrication lab that uses
natural resources for sustainable alternatives for sustainable energy and water treatments. The
sustainability of the productions and concepts in the Green FabLab are also a strength. It is an
institution that uses modern machines and systems for economic friendly solutions for the
consumption of energy and water by humans. The diversity is a very important point for the
institution, people from different nations should meet and learn together in the Green FabLab. It is
connected to the Rhine-Waal university with its multi- cultural students. Due to the fact, that people
with different nations and all ages have access to the institution it is not a place of prejudices. The
professionalism of the professors and students from the Rhine-Waal university that are implemented
in the project of the Green FabLab is another strength of it. With modern and innovative processes
the Green FabLab can become a forerunner in green energy. The Green FabLab has some
weaknesses. Due to the fact, that the Green FabLab is a new brand, it is more complex to
communicate its message. The brand has to become self-explanatory to customers. Also the product
is difficult to communicate. The Green FabLab is not a tangible product, it is an institution that
delivers an added value to customers. The location of Kamp-Lintfort is even a weakness. It is not a
capital or big city and is rather unknown, nevertheless the connections are very good to other large
cities around. The capacity and the range of the city is not as high as in other big cities in Germany.
The weakness that the Green FabLab is a new brand is also an opportunity. It do not have near
competitors and it has the chance to become a well-known and successful brand. People from
different nationalities and ages are welcome to the institution, so it has a wide target group and all
people are included when they visit the institution. Students from schools and universities benefit
from the added value that the Green FabLab transmits. Local schools and universities can
implement the visit of the institution in their learning programs. Even the Rhine-Waal university
will benefit from the visits of students from schools, the students can get interested in becoming a
student of the Rhine-Waal university. To the factor threats belongs the aspect of the brand
awareness on the market. The Green FabLab must stay on the market with ongoing projects and
events. Therefore, the improvement of the marketing strategy is important. The institution should
has a continuous number of visitors and gain partners to ensure the future success of it. To have a
continuous number of visitors, the connection to the institution should be guaranteed by public
traffic. The construction of the station in Kamp-Lintfort is very important for the sustainability of the Green FabLab. The funding is another threat for the institution. Suitable and interested partners
should be found for the future of the Green FabLab. That leads to another threat, the lack of
relevancy. People could think it is not important to invest in the Green FabLab or to visit it, due to
the fact, that they are not convinced and interested in economic friendly alternatives for energy and
water treatments. Communication ways to make the people curious about the Green FabLab are
also a threat. Suitable communications ways have to be defined and improved to gain many visitors.
With the defined aspects of the SWOT- analysis of the current status of the Green FabLab, the
marketing strategy can be improved in the future.
\section{Overall Objectives (Esther Rosenbaum}
The strategy aims for the development of an unknown establishment to a popular institution,
connected with a popular brand. A brand can be a name, a claim or an image. The term “brand“ can
be transferred to attributes, such as quality or services (Markenbildung, 2017). \\ The overall objectives of a brand are satisfaction, customer loyalty, recommendation and
recognition. To reach those objectives the process of branding must be established, which means the
development of a brand to the figurehead of the company. With concrete messages and emotions,
branding aims to differentiate the product and services of a company to the ones of the competitors.
The branding of a company can influence the whole reputation, as well as the perception of a
company (Branding, 2017). Furthermore, a brand can deliver a quality promise and form an
intangible value, which can increase the customer loyalty and affect a positive word-of-mouth
recommendation (Markenbildung, 2017). \\ There are 6 steps, one can follow to build up a brand. The first step is to define a brand. Therefor,
the business idea must be developed to determine, which products or service the company will
offer. Additionally, adjectives must be determined in order to find out which emotions will be
connected to the brand. The second step is the Corporate Design, which deals with the visual
implementation of the brand in form of a logo or a website design. The third step is to protect the
brand, either as a word mark or as a figurative mark. The fourth step, the Corporate Identity, is the
implementation of the Corporate Design to a quality promise. This includes the rules of conduct for
employees and the integrated corporate presence. The fourth step includes in addition the internal
and external communication. Internal means how employees get informed and updated and which
manners prevail. External focuses on the publication of press material or newsletters. The fifth step
includes all marketing activities to promote the brand. The last step to build up a brand is about the brand management and market research to stay up to date with the newest trends and the needs of
the target group. \\ The interdisciplinary project aims to establish a green FabLab, inspired by the already present
FabLab in Kamp-Lintfort and the FabLab Barcelona. The Marketing strategy aims to build up the
brand “Green FabLab- die grüne Werkstatt“. To adapt the six steps of building up a brand, the first
step for the Green Fablab is the brand definition. The Green Fablab is an institution in Kamp-
Lintfort and part of an international network of open laboratories, which will be implemented by the
Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences and regional partners in the horticultural show 2020.
This Green FabLab has the objective to spread knowledge about digital manufacturing and to
enable open and creative works for everyone, with the mission to create perspectives for our
common future. A Feel-Good concept will include the collection of ideas and the concept design of
the outdoor area of the Green FabLab, including meeting spaces, measures to encourage
attractiveness of the Green FabLab and a created feel-good atmosphere. \\ When people see the logo of the Green Fablab, they should immediately transfer a green and
positive image to the brand. The visual implementation of the brand, in form of the logo, includes
the corporate use of green and natural colors in the advertisement and on the website. Due to the
fact that the Green FabLab offers services, the Corporate Design includes thoughts about the
establishment and the selection of work materials. The Corporate Design can be used for the Green
FabLab to present itself as an environmental friendly, open and unique institution.
\\ To sum it up, branding is the main aspect of reaching the objective to implement the GreenFablab
as a unique brand, which is also self-explanatory for the target group.
\subsection{Target Group (Esther Rosenbaum)}
A target group is the amount of people, which come into question for buying a product of make use
of a service (Zielgruppe, 2017). \\
To focus on the target group, it must be mentioned that there are aspects to define a target group. It
includes the selectivity, which means that every person of the basic population must be able to
notice if he or she is part of the target group. Secondly, the retrievability, which means that the
target group description must be as clear as possible to identify the target group. \\
Thirdly, the accessibility, which means that the target group must be reachable with the marketing
and communication activities. The last point of homogeneity, means that the target group must be as homogeneous as possible and
differ as little as possible (Schnettler, J., Wendt, G., 2011, p. 237). \\ For a target group analysis, one has to keep in mind two different measures. First the behavior
determining measures, such as demographics and psychographic ones. For the demographic
measures, aspects such as the age, gender, confession, education, household size and in the income
has to be kept in mind. The psychographic measures comprise motives and attitudes. The second
measure of the behavior, comprises observable purchase behavior and consumer behavior. \\ Even though the GreenFabLab is a high professional institution the strategy aims to reach the
consumers, therefor it can be seen as a business-to-consumer strategy. The consumer in this case,
are visitors of the Green FabLab during and after the LAGA (horticultural show) in 2020 in Kamp-
Lintfort. The defined target group includes people, who are not yet familiar with a Green FabLab
and in detail, families with children from age 30-50 years. Additionally, the extended target group
includes grandparents. The Green FabLab addresses those visitors of the LAGA and additionally
school classes and families, who want to get familiar with this form of an open garage and
participate on workshops. Concerning the motives and attitudes, the defined target group is
interested in ecological topics, curios, active and interested in technology. This target group is
selective, retrievable, accessible and as homogeneous as possible to be interested in visiting the
Green FabLab. Furthermore, the defined target group will be reached in an catchment area of
100km around Kamp-Lintfort, which includes the Ruhrarea, the Lowerrhine, the Rhineland and
durch cities such as Venlo and Nijmegen. Therefore, an accessible amount of 1.5 million people can
be reached. The marketing strategy refers to the strategy of the horticultural show, which will also
address people in this catchment area (Marketingkonzept, 2016).
\subsection{Marketing Mix (Esther Rosenbaum)}
Main indicators of a marketing strategy are the so-called 4 P’s, which includes the product- policy
(find the right offer for the target group), price-policy (to offer the product or service in favorable
terms) , place-policy (market it in the proper distribution channels) and promotion-policy (to ensure
that the target group knows about the product or service and its added value) (Marketingmix, 2017).
Subgoals of the products policy are the product design, services and brand management. Important
for the product- policy is that due to the institution and the not directly existing product, the
marketing strategy focus on promoting the whole Green FabLab and not specific offers of it. The
price-policy can be nearly canceled for our institution, there is only the aspect of no admission fee. \\ Subgoal of the place-policy is the image of the place. The subgoals of the promotion-policy are
advertisement for brand awareness, give information and influence the image (Schnettler, J., Wendt,
G., 2011, p. 51). To refer to the Green FabLab and the product, it can be mentioned that it is an
establishment of the Rhine-Waal University and regional partners in an international network. The
Green FabLab is an open garage and unique. That applies not only for the region but also for whole
Germany. The Marketing Strategy will help to establish the Green FabLab as a single brand with
one benefit promise and one brand to focus on the requirements of the target group. Advantages for
this strategy is to address the target group precisely and to built up a distinctive, obvious brand
personality (Schnettler, J., Wendt, G., 2011, p. 141). Obviously the Green FabLab is located in
Kamp-Lintfort and a central institution. Many parts of the distribution-policy can not be applied to
our institution, therefor our location aims for the focus on attracting people for workshops and
events to connect, exchange and get a deeper knowledge of the Green FabLab. \\ The last aspect of the promotion is the most important part to generate brand awareness and
customer acquisition. The marketing strategy focuses on the institution-website, PR measures,
newspaper articles, events, radio spots, a video and additionally, a posting during the “ Lokalzeit“
news on the German television channel WDR. To make it more precise, the institution website will
be developed to give information about the Green FabLab, show upcoming events in an up-to-date
calendar, present activities, show the history and the development of the Green FabLab and points
out how to become involved and which partners are involved. The website is traceable via Search
Engine Optimization on Google and other known search engines. Important is that the website
sticks to the corporate identity in colors and logo to develop the Green FabLab as a brand. \\ The second aspect of Public Relation measures, focus to promote the whole institutions and not
specific workshops for example. Public Relations are appropriate communication measures, which
relate to the whole establishment to promote understanding and trust (Schnettler, J., Wendt, G.,
2011, p. 240). As a form of appearance the marketing strategy uses PR as newsletter for partners
and a press release for the opening. The part of the Corporate Identity belongs to PR measures as
well, in form of corporate behavior (acting green, environmentally conscious, open-minded),
corporate communications (advertisement in green and consistent) and corporate design (green and
recognizable as a brand). The aspect of sales promotion is also part of the marketing strategy in the
sense of event- promotion and knowledge transfer. Here, the tendency to business-to- business
marketing can not be excluded, due to the fact that even the visitors will be the consumers, the development of the Green FabLab and the company communication will generate awareness with
focusing on professionals and the ones who already are familiar with a FabLab. \\ Newspapers and a report on the German television channel WDR are necessary to write about the
development and the idea behind the Green FabLab. The articles are published in the region of
Kamp-Lintfort, which includes newspapers such as the „Stadtanzeiger“ and „Rheinische Post“, as
well with the online availability of the content. Additionally, the „Lokalzeit“ will inform in their
news about the current status and development of the Green FabLab, in order to attract people and
generate awareness. The strategy aims here for low-cost promotions, to finance radio spots and
generate high awareness. Regarding the radio advertisement, the Green FabLab will be promoted
with a one- week radio spot: radio channels such as WDR target people between 25 and 59 years
and cover 2.233.000 million people in the region. It can support in promoting short-term events of
the Green FabLab and can increase the numbers of visitors (Media Paket, 2017). \\ The Marketing Strategy also includes events, which are staged occurrences to address
communication content in an experienced-oriented way (Schnettler, J., Wendt, G., 2011, p. 245).
These events will address students, school classes and social institutions, such as workshop-events.
Furthermore, it includes the opening event and further events during the LAGA \\ Additionally, a video is produced to explain the Green FabLab. It is published on NRWision, which
is a German television channel for people in Northrhine - Westphalia. The video is published for
free and can address around 4 million people (Unser Sender, 2017). \\ The aspect of Social Media is an important part of the promotion- policy for the marketing strategy.
The Green FabLab will be accessible via Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. On Facebook, an own
institution website is generated to show pictures, inform about the general idea and about events. It
can help to generate brand awareness and address the younger target group. Additionally, the online
presence will be increased. The picture-based program Instagram, supports in showing illustrations
of what can be done at the Green FabLab, to make people curious about the institution. The Green
FabLab YouTube Channel shows short videos about the Green FabLab and supports as well in
generating brand awareness and inform people. There are many more ideas about how to promote
the Green FabLab besides the traditional ways of advertisement, such as flyers for schools and
universities in the region, to find sponsor partners and to generate money for more advertisement
possibilities or to be present on city festivals to present the Green FabLab and show first
implementations. These ways of advertisement are diverse and support the Green FabLab in getting famous and addressing the target group. It is necessary to stick to the Corporate Identity to transfer
the green aspect of the Green FabLab to the people.
\section{Future Outlook (Maren Quix)}
When continuing the marketing strategy presented in this paper, several points have to be taken into
consideration. \\ First of all, since the plan for the strategy is setup in detail only for the next two years and the
general plan is setup until 2022, the strategy needs to be planned further. A restriction in this case is,
that a lot of steps are still uncertain, and the following actions would be based on assumption, what
is increasing the risk for the success of the Marketing Strategy. Financial resources or other
environmental circumstances could change and may lead to a necessary adoption of the strategy.
Besides potential risks, the target group of the Green FabLab could be extended further. The
strategy is based on making the population familiar with the Green FabLab or a FabLab in general
and including the visitors of the horticultural show. But the B2B sector is still not included in the
strategy. Only several researches about exhibitions was done, but in general these exhibitions are
based on a B2C environment and not on a B2B environment. To extend the target group, a plan of
how to include businesses and B2B marketing should be developed, what would be a further step to
do. Some fairs or workshops could be chosen as communications tool to gain the attention of
potential businesses customers. Furthermore, experts could be invited to the Green FabLab to show
the possibilities the building offers. Nevertheless, the main target group should still consist of
private customers, due to the possibilities offered in the Green FabLab. \\ As possible method to specify the target group and get an even more basic knowledge about them,
question like “What is stimulating the customers?”, “By which values are they driven?”, or “What
will be the future target group?” need to be answered. By using the Sinus-Milieus, changes and
actual trends are included in the analysis of the target group of today and for the future. As further
step this model should be used to get to know the target group better and to optimize this in the
strategy (Für Gründer, 2018). \\ In the light of the fact that the Green FabLab is still not built some advertisement possibilities are
still not executed since it would not make sense. A radio sport for example has only short-term
effects. Launching the radio sport today would not influence the target group since there is no
Green FabLab they can visit now. Running a radio sport over one or more years, until the Green
FabLab is set up, would lead to high costs which would exceed the available budget. Additionally, the radio sport would annoy the potential listeners if he is repeated over a long time again and again
(Magenheim, 2005). These parameters can be applied to further marketing communication tools
what implies that their usage can only be planned right before the set-up of the Green FabLab. This
then would be further steps which have to be handled to guarantee a successful marketing strategy.
In contrasts, advertising instruments like the website or a YouTube channel, where the building of
the Green FabLab is documented or special information are presented to the target group, need to be
updated on a regular basis as further steps. A well informing website is important to create value to
the customers. A plan for including schools, kindergarten or other educational institutions would
help to familiarize the population in a early age with the technology and the Green FabLab in
general. This maybe prevents that people a developing a deterring behaviour towards the Green
FabLab due to its special technology. \\ A possible advertisement medium with a wide spread would be the television to create some
presence. This medium was already planned as advertisement tool within the strategy but due to
limitations concerning the budget and what was already negotiated with the local television show,
the producers are deciding about if a contribution about the Green FabLab is shown in the local
television show or not. Maybe in regular intervals the producer of the television show can be asked
again if he is willing to show a contribution about the Green FabLab. \\ Of course, for every task the possible budget and the feasibility of the projects need to be assessed.
If the implementation of a project or a subproject is not possible the plan needs to be revised and
restructured as long as the goals is feasible again. The presented marketing strategy in combination
with the presentation can be seen as a first draft of what and who can be reached with marketing
and specific advertisement ideas. This strategy helps to build up brand awareness for the Green
FabLab and paves the way for the Green FabLab as a brand. \\

\section{Acknowledgment}
The achievement and ultimate result of this project needed a great deal of constructive suggestions, guidance, enthusiastic encouragement, useful critiques and assistance from our professors: Herr Prof. Dr.-Ing. Rolf Becker and Herr Prof. Dr. Kai Jörg Tiedemann. Their generosity has been very much appreciated. Different efforts were necessary in achieving the outcome of this project and for each individual contribution it is possible to find the description within the Handbook. Working in the Fablab was a final important component, and surely the funniest because it also gave the opportunity to us to build something with our hands, not only do research on computer. We wish we would have had time to work more on the real prototype. \\ We will try to guide you through the individual participation to the writing of this Manual, but in case not specified the edit is done by all the Editors and the contribution in the writing is more of a general discussion than individually written. We hope what we did and achieved will be useful for further research and applications at the Rhine-Waal University and the incoming Green Fablab!
\section{Preface (Nancy Bellingan 19575)}
Managing water resources is a key feature for sustainable industrial practice as well as small-scale applications; privates all over the world are starting to use their own house wastes to produce biogas and/or biodiesel and especially the second requires large amount of water for processing the final product. Being able to clean and recycle this water would make such biodiesel production a success from the environmental point of view and the family economical budget; the produced waste are transformed into a useful product with limiting the added resources required. 
Given the Green Fablab policy and the educational role it wants to occupy together with Rhine-Waal University of applied science, developing a local biodiesel plant require a wastewater treatment plant able to clean the water and further re-utilization in the biodiesel production processes. in order to achieve a more sustainable biofuel production. 
\section{Theoretical Background}
\subsection{Overview of Wastewater Treatment (A. \& E.: Mittal 24689, Khine 18362, Jain 24499)}
Wastewater is one of the main factors of environmental pollution, transformation of aquatic ecosystem and deterioration of drinking water quality. Wastewater treatment can include physical, compound or organic procedures or mixture of these procedures relying upon the required outpouring measures. It facilitates numerous processes which in combine achieve the desired water quality objectives. The treated water can be used for dishwashing, showering, flushing the toilet and laundry. A possible treatment for such wastewater can be schematized as primary adsorption, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation processes followed by biological treatment combined with trickling filter and activated sludge system with another iteration of secondary flocculation, sedimentation process and finally, reverse osmosis with spiral membranes. Such chain of processes permits to achieve more than 90\% chemical oxygen demand removal.  [De Gis S., Galasso M., and De Feo G. (2013),pp. 861-870]
\\ The primary step is the sedimentation and anaerobic process due to the chemicals required in coagulation and flocculation steps. Secondary step is the biological treatment where a simple trickling filter is to be chosen. In the third step, the wastewater goes under a second settling process. In the final step, the process of filtration is performed to ensure no solid residues are present. 
\subsubsection{Biofiltration and Trickling Filters (Nancy Bellingan 19575) }
Biofiltration is characterised by filters made of bacteria; the structure is given by biofilm attached to solid matter, such as porous rocks, in a stable and fixed way. The bacteria density and therefore the degradation capacity of the filter is really difficult to predict and varies depending from different factors, such as temperature, pH, nutrients availability, inhibitors presence and oxygen [Henze et al 2002, pp. 168]. \\
The bacteria activity oxidises the organic matter present in the wastewater with oxygen as electron acceptor; in case of complete oxidation, the products are water and CO2.  \\
 Important parameters for biofilters are:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Volumetric loading rate $ (V_{L}): Q_{1} * c_{1} /V_{2} $ where $Q_{1}$ = flow of water in $m^{3}/d$, $ c_{1}$ = concentration of organic matter in the water (BOD often) in $kg/m^{3}$, $V_{2}$ = volume of the filter tank in $m^{3}$
 	\item Biofilm surface area can refer to either the horizontal section area of the filter ($A_{2}$) or to the surface area of the carrier ($A_{2}$*). 
 	\item Organic surface loading rate indicates the load of the surface of the carrier, describing the kinetics of the filter $ S_{L} = Q_{1} * c_{1} / A_{2} $, where $S_{L}$ = organic surface loading rate
 \end{itemize}
Trickling filters are the most conventional biofilters used in wastewater treatment; the typical stationary medium is 5-20 cm rocks, but recently also plastics and new alternatives have been used or are under research [Henze et al 2002, pp. 183].
The wastewater is more or less homogeneously distributed over the top surface of the filter media and percolates or trickles down over the medium pores and free spaces and on the bottom is again collected and carried out for the next steps of the treatment.
A ventilation at the bottom is required to guarantee proper aeration and avoid the oxygen to be a strong limiting factor, even if often a forced aeration is not required but an opening and the temperature gradient between the medium and the surrounding air suffice. An example of trickling filter in wastewater treatment can be seen in figure F.1.
\begin{figure}

		}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Sedimentation Process (A. \& E.: Mittal 24689, Khine 18362, Jain 24499)}
Sedimentation process allows particles in water to settle out of the suspension under the impact of gravity. The particles that comes out from the suspension become sediments, and in water treatment it is known as sludge. It removes the solids that are settled and stops the lighter-floating particles and grease from the extraction. It flows up through the settled sludge blanket, removes them all, except the smallest suspended solids and dissolved biological oxygen demand. Anaerobic decomposition reduces the volume of accumulated sludge. This process is implemented prior to the filtration process. At the point when a thick layer of sediment starts on settling, this is known as solidification. When solidification of sediment, or sludge, assisted by mechanical means then this is known as thickening. 
In Wastewater treatment, sedimentation process is used to reduce the concentration of particles in suspension before coagulation step so that the subsequent filtration can work most effectively. The process of separation of solids to liquids is known as clarification process.
\subsection{Biodiesel wastewater  (A. \& E.: Mittal 24689, Khine 18362, Jain 24499)}
Biodiesel is a clean burning fuel produced by transforming triglycerides into fatty acid alkyl esters in the presence of an alcohol. In the treatment process, Biodiesel is a wash water delivered from biodiesel washing procedure. It contains glycerin, untreated oil, methanol, biodiesel, pollutions, and untreated impetus. Biodiesel generation process does not bring about a lot of waste but depending upon the procedure and feedstock utilized, it can deliver some wastewater, minerals, solids made out of utilized oil and glycerin. It's viewed as a high-quality waste because of the high grouping of substances contrasted with ordinary wastewater released into the sewer framework; moreover glycerin might be an issue to lower the temperature into the pipes. Therefore, a pre-treatment of the wash water is required before disposing it or reuse in agriculture irrigation. \\
The wash water is rich in organic matter and the pH alkaline due to the catalysts used during the biodiesel process.
\subsubsection{Organic Content in Biodiesel Wastewater (Nancy Bellingan 19575)} 
The organic content, expressed often as BOD or COD (Biological or Chemical Oxygen Demand, the second usually higher), can vary due to the amount of water used in washing the biodiesel, the procedure typical for the production of the same, the chemicals used and the quality of the biomass. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item BOD: it's defined as the capacity of organic and biological matter to consume oxygen in presence of biological catalysts such as aerobic bacteria and it's often used as indicator for the organic content of an aqueous sample due to the fact the oxygen is consumed during the oxidation of the organic matter and the two quantities are proportionally related [Baird \& Cann 2005, pp. 297]
	\item COD: sometimes preferred to BOD because it's a faster analytical method, it uses chemicals with strong oxidizing potentials such as Dichromate ions and the amount of chemicals consumed in the oxidation is used to extrapolate the oxygen demanded. COD is generally a higher value than BOD, up to 4x in some cases [Baird \& Cann 2005, pp. 298]
\end{itemize} 
In Table F.1 different sources for different biodiesel production plants show how largely the organic content may vary; for the purpose of this manual and the home-made nature of biodiesel plant it will be taken 3000 mg/L as BOD reference for Biodiesel wastewater, the lowest value found.
\begin{table}
	\begin{center}

\section{Wastewater Treatment of Biodiesel (A. \& E.: Mittal 24689, Khine 18362, Jain 24499)}
Wastewater is usable for irrigation, agriculture and reusable to wash biodiesel. This treatment of biodiesel on a smaller scale requires certain process to be followed which includes the following three tanks: surge tank, settling tank and biofilter tank. An overview of the whole home-made plant, based on Crosby (2013), can be seen in figure F.2. 
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figf2.jpg}
		\caption{Wastewater Treatment three different modules [Crosby (2013)]]
		}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Surge removal and flow stabilization}
The overall tank and its labels are to be found in figure F.3. The water is introduced in the tank through a pipe (label 4); The pump moves the water from surge tank (tank 1) to settling tank (tank 2) and regulates the flow. In case of overflow of water, it is  removed via the overflow removal pipe (label 5), which will be later reintroduced in the surge tank. First sedimentation/decantation happens already at this stage. 
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figf3.jpg}
		\caption{surge flow tank/flow equalization [Crosby (2013)]]
		}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Anaerobic sludge accumulation and settling}
As it can be seen in figure F.4, the wastewater enters the tank through a pipe (label 9). It is forced to go through the accumulated sludge (label 13) for anaerobic processes and removal of suspended solids and biological oxygen demand (BOD). The sludge volume is kept under control with anaerobic degradation. Further sludge is introduced in the system from the trickling filter in Biofilter Tank (tank 3) through a pipe (label 10). The water exits the system from the pipe (label 12).
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figf4.jpg}
		\caption{settling tank [Crosby (2013)]]
		}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsection{The aerobic contact zone and trickling filter}
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figf5.jpg}
		\caption{aerobic tank and trickling filter [Crosby (2013)]]
		}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
The complex of aerobic contact zone tank and trickling filter is shown in figure F.5. The water flow from settling tank (label 13) enters this aerobic tank, oxygen is provided via an air pump (label 14). Another pump (label 15) moves the water from the tank to the trickling filter, where the dissolved biological oxygen demand (BOD) is removed. The water with the sludge are returned to the settling tank. The resultant of the wastewater treatment obtained (label 17) has gone through more than one cycle of anaerobic and aerobic purification process. The pump works for a certain level of water flow and if the level is too low, the sensors gets switched off. 
\subsection{Biological filtration in Crosby's trickling filter (Nancy Bellingan 19575)}
Crosby (2013) describe a trickling filter with novel materials in this application field; geofabrics (or geotextiles) and air furnace in alternate layers, the first one for microbial growth medium and the second for the percolation of water. In the model that he describes the total volume of the bucket used is 20 Liters and the double layer "filter" should be enough then, when tightly wrapped, fill the whole width leaving no empty space.
\\ In Figure 6 and 7 it is possible to see how the layers look (white for geofabric, blue for air furnace filter) and how tightly wrapped they are. \\
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figf6.jpg}
		\caption{Trickling filter with geofabrics and air furnace filter [Crosby (2013)]]
		}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figf7.jpg}
		\caption{In white: Geofabrics; In blue: Air furnace filter [Crosby (2013)]]
		}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
The use of geofabrics in water treatment plants is under research due to the surface area efficiency and the possibility to scale down from the large volume rockbed trickling filters used in conventional systems; Yaman (2003) published a long thesis in the matter with testing in different set-ups and with satisfying results and definitely room for improvement and commercial applications.   
\subsection{Biological filtration with rockbed trickling filter (Nancy Bellingan 19575) }
A more traditional alternative to the one proposed by Crosby (2013) is a classical approach with rock medium; Hanze et al (2002) describe the guidelines for designing biofilters following a simple approach based on parameters such as organic volumetric loading rate and hydraulic surface loading rate, previously described in the paragraph F.3.1.1; German design criteria for trickling filter with rock medium (usually 5-20 cm diameter porous spheric rocks) are listed in Table F.2. \\
\begin{table}
	\caption{German trickling filter guidelines [Hanze et al 2002, pp. 189]}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c | c |}
			\hline
			Treatment & No nitrification \\
			\hline
			Media & Rock \\
			\hline 
			Organic Volumetric loading rate V$_{L}$ kg BOD/($m^{3}*d$) & 0.4 \\
			\hline
			Hydraulic loading (inclusive recycle) m/h & 0.5-1.0 \\
			\hline 
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}
Following those guidelines, given the most optimistic organic load of 3000 mg/L from the literature [Ecologix] and an estimated 200 Liters of wastewater to treat daily for a 50 Liters Biodiesel reactor, the Volume of the trickling filter should be 1,5 m$^{3}$ as explained in equation 1.
\begin{equation}
\[ V_{TF} = \dfrac{Q * C}{V_{L}} = \dfrac{200 L/d * 3000 mg BOD/L}{400 mg BOD/(m^{3}*d)} = 1,5 m^3 \] 
\end{equation}
\\ In the contest of a wastewater treatment plant as described in this chapter, it appears obvious that such large trickling filter would be inconvenient; a solution could be to have different cycles for a smaller one, for example 200 Liters to fit the size of the other tanks, as it will be further described in the prototype design description. An initial trial of 8 cycle (assuming linearity in the scaling, which shouldn't be the case but for a conservative estimation it is fitting [Hanze et al 2003]) should be tested and if needed to increased. 
\section{Prototype Design V1 (A.:Julen Agirre 23936, E.: Mittal 24689, Khine 18362, Jain 24499)  }
\subsection{Conceptual Design}
The design of the wastewater treatment can be built easily using commonly accessible materials. The wastewater treatment plants normally constitute of complex parts working under adverse conditions: the chemical substances added in the wastewater treatment process stress the materials. The components will not suffer any relevant stress and will have lower defect probability and the maintenance will be less cost-effective. Regarding the energy usage, this prototype doesn’t need much energy, considering that two pumps are running at less than 20W.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figf8.jpg}
		\caption{Wastewater Treatment Prototype labeled by three different modules}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
The three different modules are as follows: Surge Tank, Sedimentation Tank and Biofiltration Tank as in Figure F.8.1. Each tank has its specific process to clean the wastewater delivered from the biodiesel tank washing procedure.  Every tank can contain 200 litres of volume ( 940 mm height and 550 mm of diameter) while the plastic bucket 20L (310 mm height and 300 mm of diameter).
At the beginning, a high amount of wastewater enters from the top of the Pipe 1 to the surge tank with a disturbance flow.  The wastewater starts accumulating in this tank whereas the Pump 1 starts pumping the water to the second tank providing a flow equalization and eliminating surges. At the top of the tank there is a Pipe 2 at 780mm height for removal of the overflow water from the tank. This is established to the security of not overflow wastewater from the surge tank, therefore, this tank would contain 185L at maximum. 
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figf9.jpg}
		\caption{Wastewater Treatment process labeled}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\\The wastewater is transferred from the first tank to the sedimentation tank entering the barrel from Pipe 3. In order to proceed  the sedimentation, the flow must be moderate. Using a long pipe, the flow velocity of the wastewater should not be disturbed. It closely regulates the ultra-low flow velocities creating a sludge blanket by sedimentation. This sludge blanket provides effectively as fixed-film media with exceptionally high biological contact surface area/volume at zero cost. In that way, the waste accumulates at the bottom of the tank and the upper layer of the wastewater starts getting cleaner. When the wastewater rises to the Plastic bucket 1, it then arrives to the biofiltration tank through the Pipe 4.\\ Through the Pipe 4, the wastewater enters to the biofiltration tank, where it is oxygenated by the air pump. Plastic bucket 2 is known as the trickling filter, which will be further discussed. In the next step, the wastewater is pumped into the trickling filter for an anaerobic biodegradation of the wastewater. In the trickling filter, the small particles are removed by aerated biofilter media and then the wastewater is returned to the settling tank via Pipe 3 and repeating the described steps in multiple cycles. The trickling filter bucket has several holes.  Due to the limiting factor of the process is the available oxygen, therefore, it needs to be aerated by oxygen to carry on the process.  The water flow, regulated by the pumps and an electronic control with water sensors, is such that prior leaving the system, the water goes under different cycles through the anaerobic and aerobic filtration. The top water in the biofiltration tank is then collected from the output pipe 5 as it leaves the wastewater treatment plant. The figure F.9 appreciates the process following the labelled materials.  \\ Due to a semi-automatic functioning of the treatment, in order to guarantee a stream of water which isn’t too slow or too fast and in avoidance of overflowing and loss of water from the opened tops, an electronic control with Arduino UNO is implemented with the aid of water sensors. Due to the variable characteristics of the model from the reality, it is necessary to first agree on the key elements of the model and the pump specifications before properly implementing the electronics. It will be further discussed in the prototype construction an example of how such flow control can be realized.
\subsection{Components}
After having decided the prototype design, components  have been set up. Some figures and tables have been used to indicate the components. For the surge tank components indication Figure F.10 and Table F.3 are used.

\\ Finally, biofiltration tank components are described by Figure F.12 and Table F.5. Moreover, Figure F.13 shows the geofabric filter media holder. The diameter of this trickling filter holder is 290mm using 4 legs to support geofabric filter media.

\end{table}

\subsection{Trickling Filter}
The trickling filter in this set-up is a 20 L bucket filled with alternate layers of geofabric and air furnace filter materials; the geofabric material, if possible needle nonwoven fabric as suggested by Yaman [2003], is the media for the bacteria growing, while the air furnace filter is for a good aeration and for the percolation of water. At the bottom of the bucket there is a “holder”, figure F.8.2.4, whose purpose is to guarantee a better aeration for the bottom part of the filter media; openings in the plastic of the bucket let the air exchange and the small holes  in the holder allow the water to flow up to the next stage of the treatment without leaking out but channelized into an output pipe.
\subsection{Materials and Components Possible shoplist} 
 An estimation of the price of the prototype, given the model just described, is of around 400-450  €. The list of the materials and correspondent price and supplier is to be found in the table F.6. Most of the cost comes from the barrels, the pumps and the trickling filter materials.
 \begin{table}

\newpage
\section{Prototype design v2 (A.:Julen Agirre 23936, E.: Mittal 24689, Khine 18362, Jain 24499)}
\subsection{Conceptual Design}
The general process and the flow of the wastewater in order to complete the treatment is same as prototype design version 1. However, in this version of the prototype the trickling filter is not anymore contained into 20L bucket, but it requires a larger volume due to a change in the material from geofabric and furnace filter to a more typical rocks and pebbles. A new design requires to  consider the new factors to be involved. In Figure F.14 it is possible to see the new version of the wastewater treatment prototype in two different perspectives. 
 	\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figf14.jpg}
		\caption{Prototype Volume 2 of wastewater treatment}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\\ The new design demanded to construct an additional framework to hold the trickling filter with a proper structure stability above the sedimentation tank. The flow of the water at the time of leaving the trickling is estimated to be low and discontinuous. So, it is preferred to transfer the water to the next tank by the impact of gravity instead of using another water pump. The application of another water pump will make the functioning more complex. Also due to space optimization, it is decided to locate the trickling filter barrel above the sedimentation tank. 

\\The framework has a wooden base to which vertical metal rods are welded; horizontal elements are required to provide structural stability, by connecting the vertical rods, and as physical support for the top barrel as well as the trickling filter; a metal grid can suffice for such purpose. On one side, the horizontal rods are screwed and not welded in order to allow the potential movement of the barrel out of the framework. 

 \\ As explained in the prototype version 1, there is a control of the flow given by the pumps coordinated thanks to Arduino Uno and water sensors positioned in the tanks. It will be further discussed in the prototype construction an example of how such flow control can be realized.
\subsection{Components}
Most of the components of the prototype model version 2 are similar to the first one, and therefore won't be described; for what concerns the Surge tank and the sedimentation tank, it's possible to look into paragraph F.5.2. \\ What differs is the biofiltration tank and trickling filter: In the new prototype design, biofiltration tank is divided mainly in two parts due to trickling filter new dimensions: principal barrel and trickling filter barrel. Figure F.15 and Table F.7 have been used to describe biofiltration tank components. Furthermore, Figure F.16 shows the new trickling filter holder design. The diameter has changed to 510 mm and due to the weight it has to support there are  14 legs.

\\ Finally, framework has been utilized to hold the trickling filter tank above the sedimentation tank. The framework is constituted mainly by 30x30mm recessed steel rods and 1000x1000mm wood structure as in Figure F.17 can be seen. However, this components has been estimated at the beginning  but then when building has been running,  new components have been added to perform the prototype correctly. In section 10. prototype construction the detailed description of the components is mentioned.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Trickling filter}
As described under paragraph F.4.5, for biodiesel wastewater there is need of large trickling filters with rock media due to the heavy organic content load; in order to keep this prototype a small scale one, it was decided to have 200 L volume and multiple cycles for the water to be treated, instead than a single cycle but a larger rock tank (around 1500 L). Also in this model there is need of an holder to have air exchange for a better aeration from bottom top.
\subsection{Materials and Components Possible shoplist}
An estimation of the price of the prototype, given the model just described, is of around 500  €. The list of the materials and correspondent price and supplier is to be found in the table F.8. Most of the cost comes from the barrels, the pumps and the trickling filter materials, which in this case is rocks of a certain porosity and size and to be careful selected. \newpage
